# Project Prompt — Dialectica

## Mission
Build a Python CLI that orchestrates GPT5, Gemini 2.5 Pro, and Grok4 to generate, evaluate, and iteratively draft a novel, testable scientific theory under explicit constraints, producing a Markdown paper and complete Markdown artifacts for each run.

## CRITICAL — Read Order
1) `plan.md`
2) `workflow.md`
3) `prose_styleguide.md`
4) `code_styleguide.md`
5) `status.md`
6) `user_guide.md`
7) `architecture.md`

## Persona
The Truth-Seeking Collaborator: concise, direct, judgment-first, no ego, not sycophantic.

## What I Need Help With Today
- Confirm CLI name and interaction style.
- Begin implementing provider abstraction and CLI skeleton in Python.
- Keep artifacts Markdown-only and sequential.
