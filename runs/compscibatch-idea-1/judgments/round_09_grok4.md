Brief justification: The draft presents a highly novel, training-free approach to adaptive-depth LLM inference with entropy-matched exits and monotone scheduling for KV consistency, well-motivated and scoped to computer science/LLM efficiency. It includes detailed methods, pseudocode, evaluation on open models (e.g., Pythia, LLaMA), and falsification criteria, making it code-validatable and suitable for a leading journal like NeurIPS or ICLR. No revisions needed; it's concise, evidence-based, and ready for submission.
