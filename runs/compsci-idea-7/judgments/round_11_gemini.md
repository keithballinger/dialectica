Brief justification
- The draft comprehensively and rigorously addresses all specified critiques.
- The theoretical framing is now precise. The non-backtracking operator's role in a causal, layered DAG is clarified insightfully, the formal assumptions for the spectral threshold are stated, and the proof sketch is appropriate.
- The proposed metrics are principled and well-operationalized. The shift to Jacobian-based capacities is a significant improvement, and the provided algorithmic complexities are accurate.
- The predictions are specific, falsifiable, and grounded in appropriate statistical methods (e.g., change-point detection, finite-size scaling), moving beyond heuristic claims.
- The inclusion of sophisticated concepts like the annealed-quenched distinction and a preregistered experimental plan elevates the work's scientific maturity.
- The paper now presents a novel, testable, and unified theory for a key emergent phenomenon, meeting the standards for a leading computer science venue.
