4) Entropy Gap Characterizing Cuspidality of Sym^2 Lifts
Summary: The prime-sign entropy of a_p(f) (viewed as signs of normalized coefficients) is strictly lower for GL(2) newforms with non-cuspidal Sym^2 lift (CM) than for those with cuspidal Sym^2, with a quantifiable gap stable across levels and weights.
For a smart layperson: If you binarize the prime data into plus/minus, CM forms show a more predictable pattern than non-CM ones. This predictability can be measured as lower information content (entropy). The entropy gap acts as a diagnostic for the deeper functorial nature of the symmetric-square lift.
Falsification: For CM and non-CM datasets (e.g., weight 2 newforms up to large level), compute normalized signs of a_p/2√p and estimate entropy rates via block or Lempel–Ziv estimators on primes p ≤ X. Reject if the estimated entropy gap diminishes to zero as X grows or is not consistently positive across families.
Novelty: It introduces an information-theoretic invariant of prime coefficients that cleanly separates cuspidal vs non-cuspidal symmetric-square functorial behavior.
