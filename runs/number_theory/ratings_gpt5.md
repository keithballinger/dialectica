1) Score: 7/10 — Major Revisions: Concept is natural and testable with Sage data and explicit SU(2)×SU(2) pushforward, but novelty is moderate since it reframes expected tensor-product Sato–Tate rather than a new theorem.
2) Score: 4/10 — Reject: Strong falsifiability via W1 fits, but the predicted 1/log X rate and explicit constants contradict standard sampling/GRH heuristics and are likely false despite easy simulations.
3) Score: 6/10 — Major Revisions: Proposes a universal 1/log Q correction consistent with RMT lower-order heuristics and is numerically testable, but feasibility is marginal (zero computations for many Rankin–Selberg L-functions) and universality may fail due to arithmetic terms.
4) Score: 8/10 — Minor Revisions: Novel information-theoretic diagnostic with clear CM vs non-CM signal and straightforward Python validation on LMFDB datasets, though care is needed to treat inert primes and estimator bias.
5) Score: 7/10 — Minor Revisions: Clear, falsifiable covariance criterion with affordable computations and known theoretical backbone (twists/base change), but conceptual novelty is moderate.
6) Score: 4/10 — Reject: Easy to test, but the asserted nonzero split–inert mean difference appears theoretically unfounded since Sato–Tate centering predicts zero averages outside base-change artifacts.
7) Score: 5/10 — Reject: Simulations are feasible, but the uniqueness/optimality claim likely fails (optimal 1D transport is the quantile map, not the Chebyshev lift), so correctness and novelty are doubtful.
8) Score: 4/10 — Reject: Numerically tractable, but the proposed 1/log X decay and zero/nonzero constants conflict with analytic and sampling error heuristics which suggest faster (∼1/√π(X)) decay.
9) Score: 7/10 — Major Revisions: Endoscopic mixture-model signature is interesting and testable on existing GSp(4) data, but data scarcity and precise mixture identification could hinder feasibility and novelty is moderate.
10) Score: 6/10 — Major Revisions: The 1/log Q scaling aligns with RMT intuition and is testable, yet numerical computation of first zeros for many Rankin–Selberg L-functions is heavy and universality across pairs is uncertain.
