1) Score: 9/10 — A highly novel and feasible simulation that directly tests a key distributional consequence of tensor-product functoriality.
2) Score: 10/10 — Proposes a precise, falsifiable convergence rate law, a significant and computationally tractable refinement of the classical Sato–Tate conjecture.
3) Score: 9/10 — Addresses a fundamental problem by predicting a universal finite-conductor correction term, though its numerical verification is computationally demanding.
4) Score: 9/10 — Introduces a novel and computationally cheap information-theoretic invariant that provides a clean statistical test for a deep functorial property.
5) Score: 8/10 — Formulates a clear, practical, and highly feasible covariance-based criterion for numerically detecting functorial relationships from raw prime data.
6) Score: 10/10 — Provides a novel, computationally feasible, and sharply falsifiable if-and-only-if criterion for base-change using an elegant coefficient asymmetry.
7) Score: 8/10 — A highly creative idea reframing functoriality as an optimal transport problem, though its numerical falsification is less direct than other proposals.
8) Score: 10/10 — Proposes a precise, falsifiable finite-size orthogonality rate, a deep and computationally testable refinement of asymptotic character relations.
9) Score: 9/10 — Offers a concrete, testable mixture-model signature for the subtle phenomenon of endoscopy, contingent only on sufficient GSp(4) data availability.
10) Score: 9/10 — A striking and fundamental prediction for the scaling of the first L-function zero, though its validation requires significant computational resources.
