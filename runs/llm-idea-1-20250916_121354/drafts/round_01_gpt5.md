Title: Entropy-Gated Reflective Decoding: Spending Test-Time “Thinking” Only When the Model Is Uncertain

Abstract
We propose Entropy-Gated Reflective Decoding (EGRD), a simple, training-free inference procedure that triggers short, bounded “reflect” segments only when the model’s next-token predictive entropy exceeds a threshold. The reflect segments are appended to the model’s hidden context (scratchpad) but excluded from user-visible output, and they are tightly budgeted in length and total frequency. EGRD aims to deliver a Pareto improvement in accuracy versus total compute over both no-CoT and fixed CoT decoding by applying extra computation precisely at high-uncertainty steps. The approach is lightweight, compatible with small open-source models, and can be validated with code in a few hundred lines. We outline a falsification plan on GSM8K and BBH that compares accuracy, tokens, and latency across baselines. If no Pareto frontier expansion is observed at any threshold/length configuration, the hypothesis is falsified.

Introduction
Large Language Models (LLMs) benefit from explicit reasoning or “thinking” at test time (e.g., chain-of-thought, self-reflection), but naïvely enabling such processes for every example or throughout the entire generation wastes compute and increases latency. In many cases, the model is already highly certain about the next token; reflective tokens add cost but not value.

We introduce Entropy-Gated Reflective Decoding (EGRD), a token-level controller that:
- Monitors the model’s predictive uncertainty at each step via next-token entropy.
- Briefly “thinks” (generates a short scratchpad segment) only when uncertainty is high.
- Resumes normal decoding when uncertainty falls below a threshold.

EGRD is training-free, requires no architectural changes, and is straightforward to integrate into standard decoding loops. By allocating compute adaptively, it targets higher accuracy per unit compute and better latency–quality trade-offs than static strategies. The central, falsifiable claim is that uncertainty-gated thinking improves the accuracy–compute Pareto frontier over fixed CoT and no-CoT baselines on reasoning-heavy tasks.

Method
Overview
At each decoding step t, we compute the next-token distribution p_t over the vocabulary V from logits. We define entropy H_t = −∑_{i∈V} p_t(i) log p_t(i). If H_t exceeds a chosen threshold τ, we invoke a bounded reflective segment of at most L_reflect tokens, generated under a reflection-specific prompt and decoding settings. These reflective tokens are appended to the model’s internal context but not surfaced to the user. After reflection, we continue normal decoding of the answer. We enforce a global budget on the number of reflective segments or tokens.

Gating signal
- Base entropy: H_t = −∑ p_t(i) log p_t(i).
- Normalized entropy (optional): H̃_t = H_t / log |supp_t|, where supp_t is the nucleus/top-k support used for sampling. This compensates for varying effective support under different decoding policies.
- Practicality: The log-softmax is already computed; entropy is a single pass over top-k or nucleus support.

Reflection prompt and confinement
We append a reflection header token sequence (e.g., <REFLECT>) and a compact directive, such as:
“You seem uncertain about the next step. Briefly reason about the subproblem and outline the next step in ≤2 short sentences. Be concise. End with ‘PLAN: ...’.”
We then decode up to L_reflect tokens (temperature T_reflect ≥ baseline temperature to explore alternatives), and terminate early if an end marker (e.g., </REFLECT>) or newline count is reached. Reflection tokens remain in the internal context; we then append a control marker <FINAL> to shift the model back to answer mode with baseline decoding settings.

Budgets and safeguards
- Per-step budget: at most one reflection per k tokens of answer text.
- Global budget: at most B_reflect tokens per example (hard cap).
- Early suppression: after a reflection, require a cooldown window of c tokens before another reflection is allowed unless H_t > τ_high > τ (a hysteresis band to prevent oscillation).

Decoding settings
- Answer mode: greedy or low-temperature with normal top-p/top-k.
- Reflect mode: slightly higher temperature and/or higher top-p to explore latent reasoning paths, bounded by L_reflect.

Algorithm (pseudocode)
- Inputs: model M, prompt P, thresholds τ (and optionally τ_high), L_reflect, budgets (B_reflect, cooldown c), decoding params for answer and reflect modes.
- State: visible_output = “”, hidden_context = P, reflect_used = 0, cooldown_ctr = 0.
- Loop:
  1. logits = M(hidden_context)
  2. p = softmax(logits[-1]); compute entropy H (top-k or nucleus support if desired)
  3. if (H > τ) and (reflect_used < B_reflect) and (cooldown_ctr == 0):
       - hidden_context += “<REFLECT>” + brief directive
       - Generate up to L_reflect tokens with reflect decoding params; stop on </REFLECT> or length
       - hidden_context += “</REFLECT><FINAL>”
       - reflect_used += tokens_generated; cooldown_ctr = c
     else:
       - token = sample next answer token (answer decoding params)
       - hidden_context += token
       - if token is user-visible (i.e., not control markers), append to visible_output
       - cooldown_ctr = max(0, cooldown_ctr - 1)
  4. Stop when EOS or task-specific stop condition.
- Return visible_output.

Calibration of τ
- Fixed τ: choose τ to target a budgeted fraction (e.g., ~10–30%) of steps invoking reflection on a calibration set.
- Quantile τ: estimate the α-quantile of entropy values on a small dev set and set τ to match a desired reflection rate.
- Dynamic τ: adapt τ to maintain a running budget over the sequence (stricter early; looser near the end if budget remains).

Why entropy?
- Entropy is a local, cheap proxy for uncertainty and correlates with downstream correctness in many generation settings.
- Token-level entropy offers finer granularity than example-level confidence and allows timely interventions.

Experiments (Falsification Plan)
Hypothesis
EGRD expands the Pareto frontier of accuracy versus compute (tokens and latency) relative to no-CoT and fixed CoT baselines on reasoning tasks. If no configuration of τ and L_reflect provides a Pareto improvement, the hypothesis is falsified.

Datasets
- GSM8K: grade-school math word problems; metric: exact-match accuracy.
- BBH (selected suites): diverse reasoning tasks; metric: task-specific exact or multiple-choice accuracy.

Models
- Open-source, small to mid-size instruction-tuned models:
  - Mistral-7B-Instruct or Mixtral-8x7B-Instruct (if resources allow).
  - Llama-3-8B-Instruct or Qwen2-7B-Instruct.
- All experiments run on identical hardware; measure end-to-end latency.

Baselines
- No-CoT: standard decoding (greedy or chosen temperature/top-p).
- Fixed CoT: prepend “Let’s think step by step” and allow unrestricted chain-of-thought until an enforced final-answer marker; also include a budgeted CoT variant with a fixed cap (e.g., 64 tokens of scratchpad every time).
- Optional: Self-consistency (SC) with n samples for fixed CoT to reflect common practice.

EGRD Variants
- Entropy gate with fixed τ; L_reflect ∈ {8, 16, 32}.
- Normalized-entropy gate (H̃).
- Hysteresis: τ_high = τ + Δ to avoid repeated triggering.
- Temperature schedule: T_reflect ∈ {T_ans, T_ans + 0.2}.

Metrics
- Primary: accuracy (per task), total generated tokens (visible + hidden), wall-clock latency.
- Secondary: reflections per example, average reflection length, fraction of steps with reflection.
- Pareto analysis: compare accuracy vs tokens and accuracy vs latency across methods.

Protocol
- Calibrate τ on a 5–10% dev split to target a reflection budget (e.g., ≤25% of tokens).
- Grid-search τ over a small range (e.g., percentiles of dev entropies) and L_reflect ∈ {8, 16, 32}.
- For each configuration, evaluate on held-out test split.
- Conduct ablations:
  - Remove hidden-context integration (write reflection externally but do not feed back) to confirm that gains require internal context updates.
  - Replace entropy with max-probability (1 − max_i p(i)) and compare.
  - Disable hysteresis and measure oscillation impacts.
- Statistical analysis: bootstrap confidence intervals for accuracy; paired significance against baselines.

Falsification Criteria
- If, across models and datasets, no EGRD configuration yields accuracy improvements at equal or lower total tokens/latency than fixed CoT, and no accuracy gain over no-CoT at modest overhead (≤20% extra tokens), the hypothesis is rejected.

Implementation Notes
- Minimal code changes to a standard incremental decoding loop.
- Reflection segments can be marked with reserved tokens to prevent leakage into user-visible output.
- Open-source release: reference implementation in Python with HuggingFace Transformers; scripts for calibration, evaluation, and plotting Pareto curves.

Discussion
Intuition and expected behavior
- Reflection is most useful when the model’s next action is ambiguous; entropy identifies these moments.
- Short, targeted reflective spurts can restructure local reasoning without incurring full-sequence CoT costs.
- Hysteresis prevents pathological toggling and stabilizes behavior.

Relation to prior work
- Unlike global CoT or per-example “think” flags, EGRD operates at token-level granularity.
- Distinct from speculative decoding (which reduces compute without improving reasoning) and from training-time methods that learn when to think; EGRD is training-free and drop-in.

Practical impact
- In agentic workflows, gates can trigger before tool calls or function arguments to reduce errors while containing latency.
- In interactive settings, visible output remains concise; thinking is internal and budgeted.

Limitations
- Entropy approximates uncertainty but is imperfect; poorly calibrated models may misfire gates.
- Hidden scratchpad can drift if reflection directives are ignored by weaker models; control markers and few-shot exemplars may be necessary.
- Some tasks benefit from long-horizon planning; short reflective spurts may underperform full CoT in such cases.
- Threshold calibration adds an extra step and may be task-dependent.
- Latency overhead includes extra forward passes for reflective tokens; benefits depend on the cost structure and model size.

Conclusion
We present Entropy-Gated Reflective Decoding, a simple, training-free mechanism to allocate test-time “thinking” only when the model is locally uncertain. The method is easy to implement, compatible with small open-source models, and designed for rigorous falsification via Pareto analysis on GSM8K and BBH. If validated, EGRD offers a practical path to higher accuracy per compute and improved agentic reliability without committing to full-sequence chain-of-thought.
