This draft presents a highly novel, training-free inference method for adaptive computation in LLMs, focusing on uncertainty-guided hidden reflections to improve reasoning efficiency. It is impactful for performance and quality in agentic workflows, includes a rigorous preregistered evaluation plan with code and small open-source models for validation, and is structured for publishability in a leading AI journal like NeurIPS upon completion of experiments and addition of results.
