The paper presents a highly novel, rigorous, and falsifiable microfoundation for the logit QRE temperature, linking it directly to measurable quantum device coherence. The theoretical derivation is elegant, and the extension to handle realistic asymmetric noise is both practical and insightful. Claims are substantiated with well-designed simulations in Python, and the inclusion of a detailed, statistically sound hardware falsification protocol is exemplary. The work is a significant and clearly articulated contribution that bridges behavioral economics and quantum physics.
