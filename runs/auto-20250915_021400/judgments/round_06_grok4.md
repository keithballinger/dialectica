The revised draft effectively synthesizes game theory and economics through a novel quantum-inspired model of bounded rationality, grounded in device physics. It demonstrates high novelty by linking quantum decoherence to logit QRE parameters, includes Python simulations for validation, and presents falsifiable predictions with a hardware protocol, making it suitable for publication in a leading journal in behavioral or quantum economics. No further revisions are needed.
