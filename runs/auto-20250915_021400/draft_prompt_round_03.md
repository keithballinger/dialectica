        Draft:
        Major Revisions

The manuscript presents a highly novel and compelling synthesis of quantum device physics and economic game theory, proposing a physical microfoundation for the inverse temperature parameter (β) in logit quantal response equilibrium (QRE). The core derivation linking qubit dephasing to a predictable rescaling of β is elegant and directly falsifiable. The inclusion of simulation code and a hardware experimental protocol is a major strength.

However, the manuscript requires major revisions to improve clarity, rigor, and the framing of its contribution.
1.  **Clarity of Derivation:** The central mathematical result connecting dephasing to β_eff relies on a local approximation of the log-odds slope at Δu=0. This crucial detail is understated in the Method section and only mentioned in the Limitations. It should be made explicit in the derivation itself to clarify the result's scope.
2.  **Connection to Economics Literature:** The link to rational inattention is asserted but not fully developed. The discussion should more explicitly frame the dephasing channel as a physical realization of an information channel with a specific Shannon capacity, thereby providing a physical basis for the information costs that rational inattention models typically parameterize abstractly.
3.  **Generalizability:** The claim of extending the model to multi-action games is stated without sufficient justification. This claim should be either substantiated with a concrete proposal or reframed as a direction for future research.
4.  **Presentation:** The abstract and introduction are dense and laden with technical details. They should be rewritten to first present the high-level conceptual contribution—grounding a key behavioral parameter in physics—before detailing the specific mechanism and formula. The Python code, while functional, could be improved for clarity and presentation.

# Quantum Rational Inattention Equilibrium: Dephasing Sets the Temperature of Logit Quantal Response in 2x2 Games

## Abstract
Behavioral models in economics, such as the logit Quantal Response Equilibrium (QRE), depend on a free parameter, β (inverse temperature), that quantifies players' sensitivity to payoff differences but lacks a direct physical basis. We bridge this gap by introducing the Quantum Rational Inattention Equilibrium (QRIE), a framework where β is endogenously determined by the coherence of a quantum system implementing a decision. We show that for a decision encoded on a qubit, environmental dephasing introduces a predictable and symmetric noise channel. This channel effectively rescales a player's intended decision sensitivity β₀ to a lower value β_eff = β₀ * exp(-t/T₂), where t is the computation time and T₂ is the qubit's dephasing time. This closed-form result provides a falsifiable, device-level foundation for the "temperature" of strategic choice. We formalize QRIE for 2x2 games, validate the β-scaling relationship using Python simulations with Qiskit Aer, and propose a low-cost falsification protocol on IBM Quantum hardware. Our work establishes a direct, testable link between device physics and bounded rationality in economic games.

## Introduction

In economic game theory, Quantal Response Equilibrium (QRE) provides a powerful model of boundedly rational behavior by allowing for stochastic choice [1]. In the widely-used logit specification, players' choice probabilities are a softmax function of expected payoff differences, σ(βΔu). The parameter β, often interpreted as an inverse "temperature" or rationality level, governs how sensitively players respond to payoffs. While models of rational inattention microfound β as a shadow price on information processing capacity [2], it is typically treated as a free behavioral parameter, limiting the model's predictive power.

The central challenge is that β remains an abstraction, indirectly linked to cognitive limits but lacking a direct, measurable physical origin. This paper addresses this gap by proposing that the β parameter can be grounded in the physical properties of a computational device implementing the choice.

We develop a Quantum Rational Inattention Equilibrium (QRIE) by modeling a strategic choice as a computation on a single qubit. Our primary contribution is the derivation of a closed-form, falsifiable relationship between decision sensitivity and quantum decoherence. Specifically, we show that environmental dephasing, characterized by the T₂ time, systematically reduces an agent's intended decision sensitivity β₀ to an effective value:
β_eff = β₀ * exp(-t/T₂)
where t is the effective duration of the computation. This result emerges from a specific interferometric circuit that converts quantum phase noise into symmetric classical bit-flip noise, effectively adding "temperature" to the decision process in a controlled manner.

This framework yields three key results:
1.  An analytic mapping from a physical device parameter (T₂) and a computational resource (time t) to a core behavioral parameter in economics (β).
2.  A QRIE model for 2x2 games where comparative statics are determined by device physics: equilibrium behavior becomes more random as coherence (T₂) decreases or computation time (t) increases.
3.  A concrete experimental protocol to validate the theory on existing quantum hardware, bridging theoretical economics with quantum device characterization.

## Method

### 1. Mapping Dephasing to Logit Temperature

Our method links the logit choice model to a single-qubit circuit subject to dephasing noise.

**1.1. Physical Encoding of Logit Choice**
An agent's intended choice probability for action 1, given an expected payoff difference Δu, is given by the logit function: p(Δu) = 1 / (1 + exp(-β₀Δu)). This probability can be encoded in a single-qubit state |ψ⟩ = cos(θ/2)|0⟩ + sin(θ/2)|1⟩, such that a measurement in the computational basis {|0⟩, |1⟩} yields outcome '1' with probability p = sin²(θ/2). This is achieved by setting the rotation angle θ = 2 arcsin(√p) and applying a Y-rotation gate, RY(θ), to the initial state |0⟩.

**1.2. Dephasing-to-Amplitude Conversion**
In a noiseless system, measuring this state yields the intended probability p. To model computational noise, we introduce a dephasing channel. Crucially, pure dephasing along the Z-axis of the Bloch sphere would not alter the measurement statistics in the Z-basis. To convert phase noise into choice noise, we sandwich the dephasing process between two Hadamard (H) gates. The circuit is: RY(θ) → H → idle(τ) → H → Measure.

The H-gates rotate the state from the Z-basis to the X-basis and back. During the idle period τ, the off-diagonal elements of the state's density matrix decay by a factor η = exp(-τ/T₂), where T₂ is the dephasing time. This process contracts the state on the Bloch sphere towards the center along the X-Y plane. After the second H-gate, this contraction is mapped back to the Z-axis, resulting in a new probability of measuring '1':
p'(Δu) = 0.5 + η * (p(Δu) - 0.5)
This transformation is equivalent to passing the intended choice through a binary symmetric channel with crossover probability (1-η)/2.

**1.3. Derivation of Effective β**
The effective logit temperature β_eff is defined by the local slope of the log-odds of the observed choice probability p' with respect to the payoff difference Δu, evaluated at Δu=0 (where p=0.5).
The log-odds (logit) function is l(p) = log(p/(1-p)). Its derivative is dl/dΔu = (dl/dp) * (dp/dΔu). At p=0.5, dl/dp = 1/(p(1-p)) = 4.

From the transformation p' = 0.5 + η(p - 0.5), we have dp'/dΔu = η * dp/dΔu. The slope of the intended logit at Δu=0 is β₀. Thus, dp/dΔu|_(Δu=0) = β₀/4.
Combining these, the slope of the observed log-odds at Δu=0 is:
d(l')/dΔu |_(Δu=0) = 4 * (dp'/dΔu)|_(Δu=0) = 4 * η * (dp/dΔu)|_(Δu=0) = 4 * η * (β₀/4) = η * β₀.
This implies β_eff = η * β₀. For a process with L distinct dephasing steps of duration τₖ, the total effect is multiplicative: β_eff = β₀ * exp(-Σₖ τₖ / T₂) = β₀ * exp(-t_total / T₂).

### 2. QRIE in 2x2 Games

The QRIE is defined by replacing β with β_eff in the standard logit QRE fixed-point equations. For a two-player game where player i's payoff is Uᵢ(aᵢ, aⱼ), the equilibrium strategies (p*, q*) are a fixed point of the system:
-   p* = σ(β₁,eff * Δu₁(q*))
-   q* = σ(β₂,eff * Δu₂(p*))
where p and q are the probabilities of choosing action 1, Δuᵢ is the expected payoff difference for player i given the opponent's strategy, and βᵢ,eff = βᵢ,₀ * exp(-tᵢ/T₂,ᵢ) for each player i. Existence of the equilibrium follows from standard Brouwer fixed-point arguments.

The model predicts that equilibrium play becomes more random (strategies move closer to 0.5) as device coherence T₂ decreases or computation time t increases.

## Experiments and Falsification

We provide a simulation-based validation and a hardware falsification protocol.

### 1. Simulation Validation with Qiskit Aer

We simulate the β_eff scaling relationship. For a grid of Δu values, we calculate the intended probability p = σ(β₀Δu), construct the corresponding quantum circuit, apply simulated dephasing noise for a duration τ, and measure the resulting probabilities p'. We then fit a new logistic curve p' ≈ σ(β_fit Δu) to find the effective β. The simulation verifies that β_fit ≈ β₀ * exp(-τ/T₂).

    return popt[0]

        fitted_betas.append(beta_fit)

    return np.array(taus), np.array(fitted_betas)
```

### 2. Hardware Falsification Protocol

The theory can be falsified on a cloud quantum platform (e.g., IBM Quantum) with minimal cost.
1.  **Calibrate:** Select a backend and obtain its latest reported T₂ value for the chosen qubit.
2.  **Design Circuits:** For a grid of ~7 Δu values and ~4 `delay` durations τ (e.g., spanning from 0 to T₂/2), construct the corresponding circuits using the backend's native `delay` instruction.
3.  **Execute:** Run each circuit for ≥10,000 shots.
4.  **Analyze:** For each τ, fit the observed probabilities against Δu to estimate β_fit(τ).
5.  **Test:** Compare the fitted values β_fit(τ) against the theoretical prediction β_pred(τ) = β₀ * exp(-τ/T₂). The theory is supported if the fitted values fall within a reasonable error margin (e.g., 15%) of the prediction across the range of τ.

## Discussion

**Economic Interpretation:** QRIE provides a physical operationalization of bounded rationality. The "cost" of making a precise decision (high β) is manifested as a requirement for longer coherence times (high T₂) or faster computations (low t). This reframes information processing costs from an abstract penalty term to a budget of physical coherence.

**Relation to Rational Inattention:** In classical rational inattention theory, an agent chooses a costly information channel to reduce uncertainty. The β parameter is the Lagrange multiplier on the information cost, often measured by the mutual information between states and signals. Our model provides a physical realization of this: the H-dephase-H sequence implements a binary symmetric channel whose capacity (mutual information) is `1 - H₂((1-η)/2)`, where `H₂` is the binary entropy function and η = exp(-t/T₂). For small noise (η ≈ 1), this capacity is approximately linear in η. Our slope-based derivation β_eff = ηβ₀ provides a direct link between the channel's physical parameter η and the agent's decision sensitivity, solidifying the connection.

**Future Directions:** The current derivation is exact for the local slope in 2x2 games. Extending this framework to multi-action (N>2) games is a promising direction. This would likely require multi-qubit state encodings and interferometric measurement schemes designed to map multi-dimensional dephasing onto the choice simplex, which presents non-trivial theoretical and experimental challenges.

## Limitations

-   **Local Approximation:** The equality β_eff = ηβ₀ is derived from the local slope of the log-odds at Δu=0. While the logistic function provides an excellent global fit in simulations, the fitted β over a wide range of Δu is an approximation to this local value.
-   **Noise Model:** Our model assumes pure dephasing. Real quantum hardware experiences other errors like amplitude damping (T₁ decay), gate errors, and crosstalk. Our proposed falsification protocol accounts for this by testing against the device's measured T₂ and allowing for a reasonable error tolerance.

## Conclusion

We introduced Quantum Rational Inattention Equilibrium (QRIE), a framework where the rationality parameter β of logit QRE is determined by the physics of quantum decoherence. We derived the closed-form relationship β_eff = β₀ * exp(-t/T₂), linking decision sensitivity to a qubit's dephasing time T₂ and computation time t. This result arises because a specific circuit structure converts quantum phase noise into symmetric classical choice noise, effectively raising the "temperature" of strategic decisions. We validated this scaling with simulations and proposed a direct, low-cost experimental test. QRIE provides a powerful, falsifiable, and physically-grounded theory for a fundamental parameter in behavioral economics, opening a new avenue for dialogue between device physics and the study of strategic behavior.
