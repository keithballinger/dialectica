1) Score: 10/10 — It forges a fundamental, testable link between a physical noise process (decoherence) and a core economic model of bounded rationality (logit response).
2) Score: 9/10 — It provides a quantitative, testable equilibrium selection rule mapping entanglement fidelity to the classic payoff-versus-risk dominance tradeoff.
3) Score: 10/10 — It derives an optimal bid-ask spread directly from a fundamental physical limit on information (the Helstrom bound), a highly novel synthesis.
4) Score: 9/10 — It isolates quantum coherence as a sufficient resource to break the foundational revenue equivalence principle in auction theory.
5) Score: 8/10 — The idea is strong but demonstrating an expanded Pareto frontier is a slightly less sharp falsification target than a point prediction.
6) Score: 8/10 — It predicts a compelling phase transition, though experimentally verifying a sharp threshold with noisy three-qubit states presents a practical challenge.
7) Score: 9/10 — It provides a testable physical origin for the economic discount factor by linking it directly to decoherence over time.
8) Score: 9/10 — It strategically employs quantum indistinguishability to generate a new, empirically verifiable class of signaling equilibria.
9) Score: 9/10 — It offers a physically grounded and tunable model of credible commitment by mapping it to interference visibility.
10) Score: 9/10 — It demonstrates a clean, systematic, and testable deviation from classical mixed-strategy Nash equilibrium driven by quantum interference.
