        Draft:
        Minor Revisions

The manuscript is substantially improved and presents a novel, well-supported, and falsifiable link between physical device constraints and bounded rationality in games. It has successfully addressed all previous major concerns. The following minor revisions will further enhance clarity and presentation.

-   **Presentation:** The bulleted introduction is direct but lacks narrative flow. Rephrasing it as a concise paragraph would better engage the reader.
-   **Structure:** The "Generalization note" within the Methods section is forward-looking and would be more logically placed within the "Future Work" section to streamline the description of the core methodology.
-   **Code Clarity:** The simulation code is robust but would benefit from inline comments explaining the probability-to-angle encoding (`ry_for_prob`) and the rationale for setting `T1 >> T2` (to isolate dephasing).
-   **Conclusion:** The conclusion is very brief. Expanding it slightly to reiterate the main result and its broader implications would provide a stronger finish.

# Quantum Rational Inattention Equilibrium: Device Coherence Sets the Temperature of Logit Quantal Response in 2×2 Games

## Abstract
Behavioral models such as logit Quantal Response Equilibrium (QRE) hinge on an inverse-temperature parameter β that governs sensitivity to payoff differences but lacks a physical microfoundation. We propose a Quantum Rational Inattention Equilibrium (QRIE) in which β is set by the coherence of a device implementing a decision. Modeling a one-qubit interferometric circuit with dephasing sandwiched by Hadamards, we show that phase noise is converted into symmetric choice noise, yielding an effective sensitivity β_eff = χ(t) β0, where χ(t) is the device’s coherence function (χ(t)=exp[−t/T2] under Markovian dephasing). The result follows from the local slope of the log-odds at Δu=0 and is directly falsifiable. We instantiate QRIE for 2×2 games, validate the scaling in Python simulations (Qiskit Aer), and propose an on-hardware protocol with an embedded calibration of χ(t). The framework links bounded rationality to measurable physical constraints, connecting QRE to rational inattention via an explicit binary symmetric information channel.

## Introduction
In behavioral models like logit Quantal Response Equilibrium (QRE), the inverse-temperature parameter β encodes sensitivity to payoff differences but is typically treated as a free parameter, limiting predictive power. We address this by deriving a device-level microfoundation for β. Using a minimal quantum circuit that implements a stochastic choice, we show how physical dephasing maps onto symmetric classical choice noise. Our central, falsifiable prediction is that the effective sensitivity scales as β_eff = χ(t) β0, where β0 is an intrinsic sensitivity and χ(t) is the device's measurable coherence function. This operationalizes the cost of precision as a finite coherence budget, providing a physical realization of an information channel with measurable capacity. By doing so, our model grounds rational inattention in device physics rather than abstract cost functions.

## Main Result

### Theorem 1 (Device coherence sets local logit sensitivity)
Consider a single-qubit circuit RY(θ) → H → idle(t) with dephasing → H → measure in the computational basis, where the intended choice probability is p(Δu)=σ(β0Δu). Let χ(t) be the coherence factor multiplying the transverse Bloch components after idle(t). Then the observed choice probability is
p′(Δu) = 1/2 + χ(t) [p(Δu) − 1/2],
and the local log-odds slope at Δu=0 satisfies
β_eff = χ(t) β0.
Under Markovian dephasing, χ(t)=exp(−t/T2). For multiple idle segments, χ(t)=exp(−∑k tk/T2). More generally, χ(t) equals the device’s Ramsey coherence function.

**Proof sketch:**
-   Encoding: RY(θ) prepares Bloch vector r=(sinθ,0,cosθ) with p=(1−cosθ)/2.
-   Basis swap: H maps (rx,ry,rz)→(rz,−ry,rx).
-   Dephasing: idle(t) shrinks transverse components by χ(t), preserving z.
-   Inverse swap: H maps back, yielding z_final=χ(t) cosθ and p′=(1−z_final)/2=1/2+χ(t)(p−1/2).
-   Local slope: logit derivative at p=0.5 is 4; dp/dΔu|0=β0/4; thus dp′/dΔu|0=χ(t)β0/4 and β_eff=χ(t)β0.

**Remarks:**
-   **Identification:** χ(t) is device-measurable via an in-circuit Ramsey calibration; no reliance on vendor-reported T2 is required.
-   **Scope:** The β mapping is exact for the local slope at Δu=0; global logistic fits approximate β_eff with an error increasing in nonlinearity and noise.

## Economic Implications and Relation to Rational Inattention
-   **Comparative statics:** For fixed β0, equilibrium play in 2×2 logit QRE becomes more random as χ(t) falls (shorter coherence or longer computation time).
-   **Information-theoretic link:** The H–dephase–H construction induces a binary symmetric channel (BSC) with crossover q=(1−χ)/2. Channel capacity is C=1−H2(q), which is strictly increasing in χ and nonlinearly approaches 1 as q→0. Thus QRIE provides a physical instantiation of an information channel whose tightness governs sensitivity to payoffs. This complements discrete-choice rational inattention, where logit arises from information constraints or entropy-regularized optimization.
-   **Literature connections:** QRE and logit foundations (McKelvey & Palfrey 1995; Goeree, Holt, Palfrey 2016); discrete-choice and random utility (Luce 1959); rational inattention and discrete choice microfoundations (Sims 2003; Woodford 2008; Caplin & Dean 2015; Matějka & McKay 2015).

## Methods

### Choice encoding and noise-to-choice mapping
-   Intended logit: p(Δu)=σ(β0Δu).
-   Circuit: RY(θ(p)) → H → idle(t) (dephasing) → H → measure.
-   Transformation: p′=1/2+χ(t)(p−1/2), equivalent to a BSC with q=(1−χ)/2.

### QRIE for 2×2 games
Let player i’s mixed strategy be pi and Δui be the expected payoff difference given the opponent’s strategy. Define βi,eff=χi(ti) βi,0. The QRIE fixed point is
pi = σ(β1,eff Δu1), qj = σ(β2,eff Δu2),
with existence by standard continuity and compactness arguments. Comparative statics inherit monotonicity in βi,eff.

## Simulation and Validation

### A. Minimal analytic Monte Carlo (no quantum backend)
We directly apply p′=1/2+χ(t)(p−1/2), fit a single-parameter logistic to p′ versus Δu, and verify β_fit≈χ(t)β0. This isolates the statistical fitting pipeline from hardware and confirms the local-to-global approximation regime.

```python
import numpy as np
from scipy.optimize import curve_fit

# Seed for reproducibility
rng = np.random.default_rng(123)

def logistic(x, beta):
    return 1.0 / (1.0 + np.exp(-beta * x))

def simulate(beta0=2.0, chis=(1.0, 0.9, 0.7, 0.5), U=2.0, n=41, shots=20000):
    x = np.linspace(-U, U, n)
    p = logistic(x, beta0)
    fits = []
    for chi in chis:
        # Apply the channel transformation derived in the main result
        pprime = 0.5 + chi * (p - 0.5)
        # Simulate binomial sampling
        y = rng.binomial(shots, pprime) / shots
        # Fit the observed probabilities to recover the effective beta
        beta_fit, _ = curve_fit(logistic, x, y, p0=[beta0], bounds=(0, np.inf))
        fits.append(beta_fit[0])
    return np.array(chis), np.array(fits)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    chis, betas = simulate()
    print("chi:", chis)
    print("beta_fit:", betas)
```

### B. Qiskit Aer validation with thermal relaxation
We attach a `thermal_relaxation_error` with time t to a single identity gate to realize χ(t)=exp(−t/T2) under negligible T1.

```python
import numpy as np
from qiskit import QuantumCircuit, transpile
from qiskit_aer import AerSimulator
from qiskit_aer.noise import NoiseModel, thermal_relaxation_error
from scipy.optimize import curve_fit

def logistic(x, beta):
    return 1.0 / (1.0 + np.exp(-beta * x))

def ry_for_prob(p):
    """Maps a probability p in [0,1] to a rotation angle for RY gate."""
    p = np.clip(p, 1e-12, 1-1e-12) # Avoid domain errors for arcsin
    return 2.0 * np.arcsin(np.sqrt(p))

def noise_model_T2(T2, t, T1_scale=1e6):
    """Create a noise model for pure dephasing (T2 << T1)."""
    # Setting T1 >> T2 isolates dephasing (phase noise) from amplitude damping.
    nm = NoiseModel()
    err = thermal_relaxation_error(T1=T1_scale*T2, T2=T2, time=t)
    nm.add_quantum_error(err, ['id'], [0]) # Apply to identity gates on qubit 0
    return nm

def circuit_with_dephase(p):
    qc = QuantumCircuit(1, 1)
    qc.ry(ry_for_prob(p), 0) # Encode probability p
    qc.h(0)
    qc.id(0)   # Noise is applied here during idle time t
    qc.h(0)
    qc.measure(0, 0)
    return qc

def fit_beta(x, y):
    beta, _ = curve_fit(logistic, x, y, p0=[1.0], bounds=(0, np.inf))
    return beta[0]

def run(beta0=2.0, T2=60e-6, t_list=(0.0, 10e-6, 20e-6, 30e-6),
        U=2.0, n=21, shots=40000, seed=7):
    sim = AerSimulator(seed_simulator=seed)
    x = np.linspace(-U, U, n)
    p_intended = logistic(x, beta0)
    beta_fits = []
    for t in t_list:
        sim.set_options(noise_model=noise_model_T2(T2, t))
        obs = []
        for p in p_intended:
            qc = circuit_with_dephase(p)
            tqc = transpile(qc, sim, basis_gates=['ry', 'h', 'id', 'measure'])
            res = sim.run(tqc, shots=shots).result()
            counts = res.get_counts()
            obs.append(counts.get('1', 0)/shots)
        beta_fits.append(fit_beta(x, np.array(obs)))
    return np.array(t_list), np.array(beta_fits)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    t_list, beta_fits = run()
    print("t:", t_list)
    print("beta_fit:", beta_fits)
```

**Notes:** For non-Markovian coherence, replace `exp(−t/T2)` with an empirically calibrated χ(t).

## Hardware Falsification Protocol
1.  **Embedded calibration:** For the chosen qubit, estimate χ(t) via in-circuit Ramsey (H → idle(t) → H) using the same idle durations used in decision circuits; fit χ̂(t).
2.  **Decision circuits:** For a grid of Δu and multiple t, run the choice circuits; shots ≥10k.
3.  **Estimation:** For each t, estimate β_fit(t) by fitting a logistic curve to observed probabilities versus Δu.
4.  **Test:** Compare β_fit(t) to β0 χ̂(t). Success criterion: mean relative deviation within a pre-registered tolerance (e.g., 10–20%), accounting for sampling error and residual gate noise.
5.  **Robustness:** Vary β0 via software scaling of Δu, repeat across qubits, and randomize circuit order to mitigate drift.

## Discussion
-   **Interpretation:** QRIE reframes bounded rationality as a physical resource problem: achieving sharper responses (higher β) requires longer coherence or shorter computations. This yields device-driven comparative statics and cross-context predictions when χ(t) changes.
-   **Identification:** The mapping β_eff=χ(t)β0 allows separation of “intrinsic” β0 from environment-induced attenuation if χ(t) is measured independently, providing a path to structural estimation in lab and field-like settings.
-   **Relation to rational inattention:** The induced BSC with crossover q=(1−χ)/2 has capacity C=1−H2(q), nonlinearly increasing in χ. Our local-slope mapping ties behavioral sensitivity to a physically instantiated information channel, complementing entropy-regularized or mutual-information-constrained choice models.

## Limitations
-   **Local approximation:** β_eff refers to the log-odds slope at Δu=0. Global logistic fits can bias β_fit at large |Δu|; report fit ranges and residuals.
-   **Noise model:** Real devices exhibit amplitude damping, control errors, and non-Markovian dephasing. We mitigate via embedded χ(t) calibration and robustness checks.
-   **External validity:** The one-parameter noise family may not capture context-dependent cognitive frictions; our contribution is a device-level microfoundation for one prominent component of bounded rationality.

## Future Work
-   **Multi-action extensions:** Generalizing to N-action games requires an N-ary stochastic map, for instance using multiport interferometers or qudit encodings, that converts phase noise into symmetric perturbations on the probability simplex. Future work should provide a constructive design and analyze the identifiability conditions, such as characterizing when a single coherence parameter χ(t) is sufficient.
-   **Endogenous time choice:** Allow agents to select computation time t, trading off coherence consumption against expected payoff. This would yield testable predictions about speed-accuracy rationality frontiers.
-   **Structural estimation:** Jointly estimate β0 and χ(t) from mixed datasets combining behavioral choices and calibration runs.

## Conclusion
We establish a falsifiable, physical microfoundation for the logit QRE temperature parameter, showing it is attenuated by device decoherence: β_eff = χ(t) β0. This result emerges from a minimal interferometric circuit that translates quantum dephasing into symmetric choice noise, a process we validate with simulations. Our proposed Quantum Rational Inattention Equilibrium (QRIE) thus recasts bounded rationality as a problem of finite physical resources. By providing a protocol to measure the coherence function χ(t) in-situ, this framework makes the "cost of thinking" an observable quantity. QRIE bridges device physics and behavioral economics, enriching models of strategic choice with measurable, operational physical constraints and opening a new path for the structural estimation of rationality bounds.
