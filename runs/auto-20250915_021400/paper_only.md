# Quantum Rational Inattention Equilibrium: Device Coherence Sets the Temperature of Logit Quantal Response in 2×2 Games

## Abstract
Behavioral models such as logit Quantal Response Equilibrium (QRE) hinge on an inverse-temperature β that governs sensitivity to payoff differences but lacks a physical microfoundation. We propose a Quantum Rational Inattention Equilibrium (QRIE) in which β is set by the coherence of a device implementing a decision. Modeling a one-qubit interferometric circuit with dephasing sandwiched by Hadamards, we show that phase noise is converted into symmetric choice noise, yielding an effective local sensitivity β_eff = χ(t) β0, where χ(t) is the device’s coherence function (χ(t)=exp[−t/T2] under Markovian dephasing). The result follows from the local slope of the log-odds at Δu=0 and is directly falsifiable. We validate the scaling in Python simulations (Qiskit Aer) and provide an on-hardware protocol with embedded calibration of χ(t). The framework links bounded rationality to measurable physical constraints, connecting QRE to rational inattention via an explicit binary information channel.

## Introduction
In logit QRE, the inverse temperature β determines sensitivity to payoff differences, but it is typically a free parameter. We derive a device-level microfoundation: using a minimal quantum circuit that implements a stochastic choice, we show that physical dephasing maps onto symmetric classical choice noise and scales the local logit sensitivity. Our falsifiable prediction is β_eff(t) = χ(t) β0, where β0 is an intrinsic sensitivity (set by the encoding) and χ(t) is a measurable coherence function. This operationalizes the cost of precision as a finite coherence budget and provides a physical realization of an information channel with measurable capacity, connecting bounded rationality to device physics.

## Main Result

### Theorem 1 (Device coherence sets local logit sensitivity)
Consider the single-qubit circuit RY(θ) → H → idle(t) with dephasing → H → measure (Z-basis). Let the intended choice probability be p(Δu)=σ(β0Δu). Let χ(t) be the coherence factor multiplying transverse Bloch components after idle(t). Then the observed choice probability is
p′(Δu) = 1/2 + χ(t) [p(Δu) − 1/2],
and the local log-odds slope at Δu=0 satisfies β_eff = χ(t) β0. Under Markovian dephasing, χ(t)=exp(−t/T2); more generally, χ(t) equals the device’s Ramsey coherence function.

Proof sketch:
- Encoding: RY(θ) prepares r=(sinθ,0,cosθ) with p=(1−cosθ)/2.
- H maps (rx,ry,rz)→(rz,−ry,rx).
- Dephasing: idle(t) shrinks x,y by χ(t), preserves z.
- H maps back; z_final=χ(t) cosθ; hence p′=(1−z_final)/2=1/2+χ(t)(p−1/2).
- Local slope: at Δu=0, dp/dΔu=β0/4 and d logit(p)/dp|0.5=4; thus β_eff=χ(t)β0.

Remarks:
- Identification: χ(t) is directly measurable via in-circuit Ramsey; no vendor T2 is required.
- Scope: The mapping is exact for the local slope at Δu=0. Globally, p′ is not exactly logistic; a one-parameter logistic fit approximates β_eff with error increasing in nonlinearity and asymmetric noise.

## Economic Implications and Relation to Rational Inattention
- Comparative statics: For fixed β0, equilibrium play in 2×2 logit QRE becomes more random as χ(t) falls (shorter coherence or longer computation time).
- Information-theoretic link: The H–dephase–H construction induces a binary channel with crossover q=(1−χ)/2 (symmetric case). Capacity C=1−H2(q) rises with χ. QRIE thus instantiates an information constraint whose tightness governs sensitivity to payoffs, complementing discrete-choice rational inattention and information-theoretic bounded rationality.
- Literature connections: QRE (McKelvey & Palfrey, 1995; Goeree, Holt, Palfrey, 2016); rational inattention (Sims, 2003; Matějka & McKay, 2015; Caplin & Dean, 2015; Woodford, 2008); information-theoretic bounded rationality and thermodynamic perspectives (Ortega & Braun, 2013; Tishby & Polani, 2011; Genewein et al., 2015).

## Methods

### Choice encoding and noise-to-choice mapping
- Intended logit: p(Δu)=σ(β0Δu).
- Circuit: RY(θ(p)) → H → idle(t) (dephasing) → H → measure.
- Transformation: p′=1/2+χ(t)(p−1/2), i.e., a symmetric binary channel with q=(1−χ)/2.

### Asymmetric noise and affine correction
Real devices may exhibit asymmetric bit-flip rates (e.g., T1, control bias). Model the readout as an asymmetric binary channel with ε0=P(0→1), ε1=P(1→0):
p′ = ε0 + (1 − ε0 − ε1) p.
- Symmetric dephasing implies ε0=ε1=(1−χ)/2 and reduces to the main result.
- Estimation: fit both an intercept a (≈ε0) and slope b (≈1−ε0−ε1) via binomial GLM: p′ ≈ a + b p. The local β is attenuated by b: β_eff ≈ b β0.

### QRIE for 2×2 games
Let player i’s mixed strategy be pi and Δui the expected payoff difference given the opponent’s strategy. Define βi,eff=χi(ti) βi,0 (or βi,eff≈bi βi,0 under the affine model). The QRIE fixed point is
pi = σ(β1,eff Δu1), qj = σ(β2,eff Δu2),
with standard existence arguments (continuity/compactness). Comparative statics inherit monotonicity in βi,eff.

## Simulation and Validation

### A. Minimal analytic Monte Carlo (no backend)
We apply p′=1/2+χ(t)(p−1/2), simulate binomial sampling, and fit a one-parameter logistic. This isolates fitting bias from hardware.

```python
import numpy as np
from scipy.optimize import curve_fit

rng = np.random.default_rng(123)

def logistic(x, beta): return 1.0 / (1.0 + np.exp(-beta * x))

def simulate(beta0=2.0, chis=(1.0, 0.9, 0.7, 0.5), U=2.0, n=41, shots=20000):
    x = np.linspace(-U, U, n)
    p = logistic(x, beta0)
    fits = []
    for chi in chis:
        pprime = 0.5 + chi * (p - 0.5)
        y = rng.binomial(shots, pprime) / shots
        beta_fit, _ = curve_fit(logistic, x, y, p0=[beta0], bounds=(0, np.inf))
        fits.append(beta_fit[0])
    return np.array(chis), np.array(fits)
```

### B. Qiskit Aer validation with thermal relaxation
We attach thermal_relaxation_error at an idle of duration t to realize χ(t)=exp(−t/T2) with T1 ≫ T2 to isolate dephasing.

```python
import numpy as np
from qiskit import QuantumCircuit, transpile
from qiskit_aer import AerSimulator
from qiskit_aer.noise import NoiseModel, thermal_relaxation_error
from scipy.optimize import curve_fit

def logistic(x, beta): return 1.0 / (1.0 + np.exp(-beta * x))

def ry_for_prob(p):
    """Encode probability p via RY so that measuring |1> yields p."""
    p = np.clip(p, 1e-12, 1-1e-12)
    return 2.0 * np.arcsin(np.sqrt(p))

def noise_model_T2(T2, t, T1_scale=1e6):
    """Approximate pure dephasing by setting T1 >> T2."""
    nm = NoiseModel()
    err = thermal_relaxation_error(T1=T1_scale*T2, T2=T2, time=t)
    nm.add_quantum_error(err, ['id'], [0])
    return nm

def circuit_with_dephase(p):
    qc = QuantumCircuit(1, 1)
    qc.ry(ry_for_prob(p), 0)
    qc.h(0)
    qc.id(0)
    qc.h(0)
    qc.measure(0, 0)
    return qc

def fit_beta(x, y):
    beta, _ = curve_fit(logistic, x, y, p0=[1.0], bounds=(0, np.inf))
    return beta[0]

def run(beta0=2.0, T2=60e-6, t_list=(0.0, 10e-6, 20e-6, 30e-6),
        U=2.0, n=21, shots=40000, seed=7):
    sim = AerSimulator(seed_simulator=seed)
    x = np.linspace(-U, U, n)
    p_intended = logistic(x, beta0)
    beta_fits = []
    for t in t_list:
        sim.set_options(noise_model=noise_model_T2(T2, t))
        obs = []
        for p in p_intended:
            qc = circuit_with_dephase(p)
            tqc = transpile(qc, sim, basis_gates=['ry', 'h', 'id', 'measure'])
            res = sim.run(tqc, shots=shots).result()
            counts = res.get_counts()
            obs.append(counts.get('1', 0)/shots)
        beta_fits.append(fit_beta(x, np.array(obs)))
    return np.array(t_list), np.array(beta_fits)
```

Notes: For non-Markovian coherence, replace exp(−t/T2) with the empirically calibrated χ(t). For asymmetric noise, augment the fit with an intercept term.

### C. 2×2 QRE illustration and comparative statics
We demonstrate equilibrium implications in a 2×2 coordination game as χ varies.

```python
import numpy as np
from scipy.special import expit as logistic

# Payoffs: (A,A)=(2,2), (B,B)=(1,1), miscoordination=(0,0)
U1 = np.array([[2,0],
               [0,1]], dtype=float)
U2 = U1.copy()

def best_response(p_opp, U, beta_eff):
    # Δu = expected payoff(A) - payoff(B)
    Δu = p_opp*(U[0,0]-U[1,0]) + (1-p_opp)*(U[0,1]-U[1,1])
    return logistic(beta_eff * Δu)

def qre(beta1_eff, beta2_eff, tol=1e-10, iters=10000):
    p, q = 0.5, 0.5
    for _ in range(iters):
        p_new = best_response(q, U1, beta1_eff)
        q_new = best_response(p_new, U2, beta2_eff)
        if max(abs(p_new-p), abs(q_new-q)) < tol:
            return p_new, q_new
        p, q = p_new, q_new
    return p, q

beta0 = 4.0
chis = [1.0, 0.8, 0.6, 0.4]
sol = [qre(beta0*c, beta0*c) for c in chis]
print(list(zip(chis, sol)))
```

As χ decreases, equilibrium mixed strategies move toward 0.5, consistent with β_eff=χβ0.

## Hardware Falsification Protocol
1. Embedded calibration: For the chosen qubit, estimate χ(t) via in-circuit Ramsey (H → idle(t) → H) using the same idle durations; fit χ̂(t) with uncertainty.
2. Decision circuits: For a grid of Δu and multiple t, run the choice circuits with ≥10k shots per point (increase shots near p≈0.5 for power).
3. Estimation: For each t, fit a binomial GLM with logit link to estimate slope β_fit(t) and, if needed, an intercept (asymmetric noise). Weight by binomial variance.
4. Test: Regress β_fit(t) on χ̂(t) with zero intercept; slope estimates β0. Success criterion: pre-registered relative deviation (e.g., ≤15%) with CIs accounting for χ̂ and sampling error.
5. Robustness: Vary β0 by scaling Δu, repeat across qubits, randomize circuit order to mitigate drift, and include control runs with deliberately inserted idle segments.

## Discussion
- Interpretation: QRIE reframes bounded rationality as a physical resource problem: sharper responses (higher β) require longer coherence or shorter computations. This yields device-driven comparative statics and cross-context predictions when χ(t) shifts.
- Identification: Variation in t provides exogenous variation in χ(t), enabling separate identification of β0 given χ̂(t). The affine channel extension provides a path to correct for bias (ε0, ε1).
- Relation to rational inattention: The induced channel’s capacity increases with χ, tying behavioral sensitivity to a physically instantiated information constraint. This complements entropy-regularized and mutual-information approaches.

## Limitations
- Local approximation: β_eff pertains to the log-odds slope at Δu=0. Global logistic fits can bias β̂ at large |Δu|; report fit ranges and residuals and prefer GLM with intercept when asymmetries exist.
- Noise model: Real devices exhibit amplitude damping, control errors, and non-Markovian dephasing. Embedded χ̂(t) and affine-channel calibration mitigate these.
- External validity: The device-based microfoundation captures one component of bounded rationality; cognitive frictions may add structure beyond χ(t).

## Future Work
- Multi-action extensions: Generalize to N-action games using N-ary stochastic maps (e.g., multiport interferometers) that convert phase noise into perturbations on the probability simplex; analyze identifiability when a single χ suffices.
- Endogenous time choice: Let agents select computation time t, trading off coherence against payoff, yielding testable speed–accuracy frontiers.
- Structural estimation: Jointly estimate β0 and χ(t) from behavioral choices and calibration runs; extend to asymmetric channels (ε0, ε1).

## Conclusion
We provide a falsifiable, physical microfoundation for the logit QRE temperature: device decoherence attenuates sensitivity via β_eff = χ(t) β0. A minimal interferometric circuit translates dephasing into symmetric choice noise, a prediction validated in simulation and amenable to on-hardware tests. QRIE bridges device physics and behavioral economics by making the “cost of thinking” an observable, operational quantity.
