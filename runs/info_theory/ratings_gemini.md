Major Revisions

The proposal is strong overall, presenting ten ambitious and well-defined research ideas. Most are highly novel, falsifiable, and suitable for a top journal. However, two ideas (3 and 7) have significant feasibility or falsifiability issues that weaken their standing. Idea 3 relies on an experiment likely beyond current technological reach, while Idea 7 hinges on the uncomputable Kolmogorov complexity, making its falsification indirect and potentially inconclusive. The remaining eight ideas are excellent. The document should be revised to either replace or substantially re-scope ideas 3 and 7 to improve their experimental or computational tractability.

1) Score: 10/10 — A landmark claim unifying classical finite-blocklength theory with modern neural codes in a testable framework.
2) Score: 10/10 — A bold, definitive solution to a major open problem in information-theoretic privacy that is clearly falsifiable.
3) Score: 8/10 — A highly novel interdisciplinary link, but its core physical claim is extremely difficult to falsify with current experimental capabilities.
4) Score: 9/10 — An elegant and surprising connection between a core information-theoretic property and graph theory that is computationally easy to falsify.
5) Score: 9/10 — A highly novel and impactful lower bound on generalization, though its empirical verification is non-trivial due to estimation challenges.
6) Score: 9/10 — A sharp "if and only if" condition that cleanly resolves a classical open problem in channel coding theory.
7) Score: 7/10 — A deep conceptual bridge between algorithmic and Shannon information, but it is difficult to falsify due to the uncomputability of its key term.
8) Score: 10/10 — An ambitious attempt to uniquely solve a foundational, decade-long problem with a crisp, operational, and easily falsifiable definition.
9) Score: 8/10 — A simple, novel, and empirically verifiable scaling law with direct application to modern distributed machine learning.
10) Score: 9/10 — A sharp and testable result linking the statistical optimality of popular neural estimators to a core mathematical property.
