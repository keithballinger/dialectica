1) Score: 10/10 — A highly novel physical insight into the dominant dephasing mechanism with a direct, low-cost, and robust falsification protocol.
2) Score: 9/10 — Proposes a concrete, testable quantitative law for a known but poorly characterized source of crosstalk on the native hardware graph.
3) Score: 8/10 — Exceptionally novel link between quantum dynamics and lattice percolation, though finite-size effects may complicate definitive falsification on current hardware.
4) Score: 7/10 — A novel hypothesis linking a specific environmental source to error drift, but the required long-duration experiment introduces logistical feasibility risks.
5) Score: 8/10 — A simple and highly useful predictive law for symmetry-based error mitigation that is directly and easily testable with dynamic circuits.
6) Score: 10/10 — Directly probes a fundamental, time-resolved microscopic error mechanism (quasiparticles) with a clean, feasible, and high-impact experiment.
7) Score: 7/10 — Provides a crucial and feasible experimental validation of a core randomized compiling assumption, though the underlying concept is not new.
8) Score: 9/10 — Creates a highly valuable and predictive link between a local error metric (unitarity) and a global performance benchmark (heavy outputs).
9) Score: 8/10 — Tests a simple, compositional error model whose validity is a critical and falsifiable assumption for scalable quantum error correction.
10) Score: 9/10 — A novel, quantitative hypothesis for crosstalk-induced error under concurrent operations that is directly testable with standard techniques.
