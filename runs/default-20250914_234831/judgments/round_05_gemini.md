The proposed law is novel, directly falsifiable, and has significant implications for quantum compilers and crosstalk characterization. The experimental protocol is exceptionally well-designed: it is cost-effective (<$1000/run), executable on current IBM hardware, and robust against common systematic errors like calibration drift through a rigorous round-robin interleaving scheme. The plan for data analysis is sophisticated, employing mixed-effects models and pre-registered falsification criteria, which represents best practice in quantitative experimental science. The draft correctly identifies and mitigates key confounders, such as compilation variability and measurement errors, by using a differential asymmetry metric and explicit pulse schedule verification.
