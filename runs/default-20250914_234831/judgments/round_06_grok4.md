Brief justification: The draft is highly novel, proposing a quantifiable law for CX error asymmetries with a clear physical mechanism and geometry-aware model. It is falsifiable via a detailed, executable RB protocol on IBM quantum cloud, with costs well under $1000 (estimated $200â€“$700). The structure, analysis, and pre-registered criteria are rigorous and suitable for a leading quantum computing journal like PRX Quantum or Nature Communications, requiring no revisions.
