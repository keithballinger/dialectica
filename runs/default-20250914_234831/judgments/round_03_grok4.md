The provided critique accurately identifies minor issues in an implied original draft, and the revised draft effectively addresses them, resulting in a clear, novel, and falsifiable proposal that meets all constraints: it introduces a highly original "Spectator-Activation Law" grounded in quantum hardware physics, is suitable for a leading journal like Physical Review Letters or Quantum, specifies experiments runnable on IBM's cloud with costs under $500 (well below $1000), and includes explicit falsification criteria. No further revisions needed.
