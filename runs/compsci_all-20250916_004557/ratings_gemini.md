1) Score: 10/10 — Posits a strong, falsifiable law linking information entropy to optimal compute, which is highly novel and feasible.
2) Score: 9/10 — Proposes a specific, falsifiable logarithmic scaling law for context compression, a significant and novel claim.
3) Score: 9/10 — Offers a novel theoretical foundation for quantization based on ordinal invariance, which is clearly testable.
4) Score: 9/10 — Makes a strong, easily falsifiable claim of universality for a known technique, which would be a significant finding.
5) Score: 9/10 — Frames RAG performance using a novel phase-transition model that makes a sharp, falsifiable prediction.
6) Score: 10/10 — Proposes a fundamental, content-agnostic law for speculative decoding that is elegant and readily testable.
7) Score: 9/10 — Connects an observable quantity (surprisal) to a latent structural property (attention rank) to motivate a practical optimization.
8) Score: 9/10 — Proposes a clear, testable, and practical condition for "safe" logit steering, a valuable contribution.
9) Score: 9/10 — Claims a powerful, model-agnostic scaling law for a widely used technique, making a strong and testable hypothesis.
10) Score: 9/10 — Identifies a non-obvious and falsifiable invariance principle in advanced parallel decoding schemes.
