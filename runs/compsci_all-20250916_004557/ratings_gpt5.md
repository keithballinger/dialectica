1) Score: Novelty 7/10, Falsifiability 9/10, Feasibility 9/10 — Major Revisions: Incrementally novel given prior entropy/margin-based early-exit work but easily testable with small LLMs via dynamic depth/precision policies.

2) Score: Novelty 8/10, Falsifiability 8/10, Feasibility 7/10 — Major Revisions: Bold O(log L) claim is novel and testable with a learned salience probe, though long-context evaluation and robustness across tasks require careful study.

3) Score: Novelty 8/10, Falsifiability 7/10, Feasibility 6/10 — Major Revisions: Order-preservation as a sufficiency criterion is fresh but building quantizers that maintain cosine and top-k order reliably is technically challenging.

4) Score: Novelty 7/10, Falsifiability 10/10, Feasibility 10/10 — Reject: A single cross-model/task margin threshold is likely invalid due to calibration shifts, though falsification is straightforward.

5) Score: Novelty 8/10, Falsifiability 9/10, Feasibility 9/10 — Minor Revisions: The phase-transition framing is original and readily testable via controlled relevance sweeps with change-point analysis.

6) Score: Novelty 6/10, Falsifiability 9/10, Feasibility 9/10 — Major Revisions: Tying acceptance rate to KL is plausible but overlaps with existing analyses of speculative decoding and may need refined conditions for content-independence.

7) Score: Novelty 8/10, Falsifiability 8/10, Feasibility 7/10 — Minor Revisions: Linking low surprisal to low effective attention rank is new and empirically verifiable with rank-k approximations gated by online surprisal.

8) Score: Novelty 7/10, Falsifiability 9/10, Feasibility 9/10 — Major Revisions: Preserving top-k order under logit steering is easy to test but invariance may break on long-horizon generation or compositional tasks.

9) Score: Novelty 7/10, Falsifiability 8/10, Feasibility 9/10 — Minor Revisions: A size-invariant calibration law for self-consistency is interesting and testable across small models with temperature control, though distributional assumptions must be explicit.

10) Score: Novelty 8/10, Falsifiability 7/10, Feasibility 7/10 — Major Revisions: The branching-factor invariance claim is provocative but may conflict with verifier scheduling effects, requiring careful experimental control.
