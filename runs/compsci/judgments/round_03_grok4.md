This revised draft presents a highly novel information-theoretic framework for quantifying cache side-channel vulnerabilities, grounded in rigorous channel modeling and empirical validation across architectures. It abstracts attack predictions effectively, meets computer science subfield standards (e.g., for IEEE S&P or USENIX Security), and avoids blockchain topics. The critique addresses minor clarity issues appropriately, resulting in a polished, evidence-based manuscript ready for submission with strong potential for impact.
