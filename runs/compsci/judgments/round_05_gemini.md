The proposed framework provides a rigorous and novel approach to quantitatively predict side-channel attack success. Its core contribution—the separation of a measurable, attacker-agnostic observation channel `P(Y|X)` from a victim-induced input process `P(X|S)`—is a significant conceptual advance. The paper correctly reframes the problem from one of unconstrained channel capacity to one governed by the induced information rate and dispersion, grounding its predictors in sound, non-asymptotic hypothesis-testing theory. The proposed measurement protocol and experimental design are thorough, addressing critical assumptions like stationarity and mixing with appropriate diagnostics. The work is well-positioned to replace ad-hoc empirical evaluations with principled, testable predictions, making it a strong contribution to a leading venue.
