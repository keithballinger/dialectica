1) Score: 7/10 — Minor Revisions: novelty 7, falsifiability 7, feasibility 8; credible info-theoretic lower bounds suggest viability, but empirical entropy-rate estimation and mapping bits-to-error need tight control.
2) Score: 6/10 — Major Revisions: novelty 9, falsifiability 7, feasibility 4; the strong linearity and language/name invariance are likely overclaims given human factors, requiring tempered hypotheses and careful experimental design.
3) Score: 6/10 — Major Revisions: novelty 7, falsifiability 8, feasibility 5; architecture-invariant scaling collapse is ambitious and probably dataset/optimizer dependent, demanding rigorous dimension estimation and broad negative controls.
4) Score: 8/10 — Minor Revisions: novelty 7, falsifiability 9, feasibility 8; casting cache attacks as measurable noisy channels aligns with theory and is testable across platforms, though modeling assumptions must match real eviction/noise behavior.
5) Score: 7/10 — Minor Revisions: novelty 8, falsifiability 8, feasibility 6; the spectral-gap link to p99 is fresh and experimentally testable, but requires clarifying assumptions and disentangling from path-length and queueing effects.
6) Score: 8/10 — Minor Revisions: novelty 8, falsifiability 9, feasibility 8; a precise equivalence to adaptive kernels via Fisher information is derivable and testable, but needs clear scope (loss/step size) and boundary cases.
7) Score: 7/10 — Minor Revisions: novelty 8, falsifiability 8, feasibility 6; a percolation-style phase transition is compelling and testable with sparse attention, yet predictions must survive training dynamics and task confounds.
8) Score: 6/10 — Major Revisions: novelty 5, falsifiability 9, feasibility 8; close ties between AD memory, pebbling, and (path)width exist already, so the contribution must precisely sharpen constants/conditions beyond prior art.
9) Score: 7/10 — Major Revisions: novelty 7, falsifiability 7, feasibility 6; promising formal-entropy framing but tokenization independence and grammar induction fidelity are questionable and need moderated claims and robust controls.
10) Score: 6/10 — Major Revisions: novelty 8, falsifiability 6, feasibility 5; elegant curvature–steerability hypothesis but curvature estimation and causal linkage are fragile, so the claim should be narrowed and validated across simpler settings.
