1) Score: 10/10 — This is a foundational, architecture-independent claim that is directly and cleanly falsifiable through empirical measurement.
2) Score: 7/10 — Highly novel, but falsification is extremely challenging due to the inherent noise and confounding variables in human-subject experiments.
3) Score: 8/10 — A powerful unifying theory, though its falsification relies on estimators for manifold dimension which can be unstable and ambiguous.
4) Score: 10/10 — An elegant and rigorous application of information theory to security that is directly falsifiable by separating capacity measurement from attack evaluation.
5) Score: 9/10 — This is a non-obvious, powerful connection between graph theory and system performance that is highly falsifiable in a controlled testbed.
6) Score: 9/10 — This is a strong, unifying theoretical insight that establishes a precise, directly testable equivalence between two important machine learning methods.
7) Score: 9/10 — A creative and highly novel explanatory model for an emergent capability, with a clear, if challenging, experimental falsification path.
8) Score: 10/10 — This is a definitive and falsifiable theoretical bound connecting a core systems problem for machine learning to a canonical graph parameter.
9) Score: 6/10 — A compelling hypothesis, but its falsifiability is severely hampered by the unsolved and ill-defined subproblem of robust grammar induction.
10) Score: 8/10 — A frontier concept linking differential geometry to interpretability, with high potential impact but facing difficult estimation challenges for its key quantity.
