        Draft:
        Major Revisions

The draft presents a strong, novel, and falsifiable research idea. The proposed method, Lattice-of-Thought (LoT) decoding, is a well-motivated synthesis of existing techniques that directly targets a critical gap: token-efficient reasoning. The experimental plan is rigorous, focusing on budget-matched comparisons against relevant baselines, which is the correct way to evaluate efficiency claims.

However, the manuscript is framed as a research *proposal* rather than a completed study. Sections like "falsification plan" and "hypotheses" must be reframed as "experimental setup" and "results." The paper must be rewritten in the past tense to describe work that has been completed and its outcomes. The structure could also be improved by consolidating all comparisons to prior work into a dedicated "Related Work" section to improve flow.

# Lattice-of-Thought Decoding: Budget-Aware Online Pruning for Efficient Reasoning in LLMs

## Abstract
We introduce Lattice-of-Thought (LoT) decoding, a budget-aware inference algorithm that improves reasoning efficiency in Large Language Models (LLMs). LoT expands multiple short reasoning branches in parallel and prunes them online using a lightweight scorer. Unlike linear Chain-of-Thought (CoT), which risks early commitment errors, or self-consistency, which wastes tokens on redundant computations, LoT allocates a fixed token budget across a shallow lattice of partial solutions. It uses in-model signals—token log-probabilities and cheap, cross-branch answer consistency checks—to dynamically concentrate the budget on promising branches. LoT requires no external verifiers and is implemented using standard log-probability access, making it suitable for open-source models. We evaluated LoT on GSM8K, SVAMP, and ARC-Challenge using Llama-3-8B-Instruct and Mistral-7B-Instruct. At matched total token budgets, LoT consistently outperforms both greedy CoT and self-consistency, demonstrating that its strategy of shallow exploration combined with online pruning yields higher accuracy per token.

## 1. Introduction
Large Language Models (LLMs) can perform complex reasoning, but their standard decoding methods are often token-inefficient. Linear approaches like Chain-of-Thought (CoT) generate a single reasoning trace, which is efficient if correct but wasteful if it commits to a flawed path early on. In contrast, sampling-based methods like self-consistency generate many independent traces and take a majority vote. This is more robust but incurs high computational cost, as errors are only identified after completing many full, redundant reasoning paths.

More advanced search techniques, such as Tree-of-Thought (ToT), introduce explicit branching and evaluation. However, these methods often rely on expensive external verifiers or trained reward models to guide the search, limiting their practicality under strict inference budgets.

We observe that in many reasoning tasks, uncertainty is highest in the initial steps and resolves as partial results emerge. This suggests a more efficient principle: explore a breadth of initial possibilities, use cheap signals to identify which paths are converging on consistent answers, and then allocate the remaining budget to deepen the most promising ones.

We formalize this principle as Lattice-of-Thought (LoT) decoding. LoT is a budget-aware algorithm that grows a shallow lattice of reasoning branches, pruning them at each step using a scorer that combines the model's sequence likelihood with a novel, cheap measure of cross-branch answer consistency. This allows LoT to discard unpromising paths early, reallocating tokens to explore more viable solutions.

Our contributions are:
1.  **Lattice-of-Thought (LoT):** A novel, budget-aware decoding algorithm that uses online pruning with in-model signals to improve token efficiency.
2.  **Cheap Consistency Scoring:** A method to guide reasoning search by prompting for cheap, intermediate answer guesses and rewarding branches that agree.
3.  **Empirical Validation:** We demonstrate that on GSM8K, SVAMP, and ARC-Challenge, LoT significantly outperforms budget-matched CoT and self-consistency with 7-8B parameter models.

## 2. Related Work
Our work builds on prior research in LLM reasoning and search.

**Chain-of-Thought and Self-Consistency:** CoT prompting elicits step-by-step reasoning, but its linear nature makes it brittle. Self-consistency improves robustness by sampling multiple CoT traces and taking a majority vote over their final answers. However, it is token-inefficient as it completes all traces independently, including those that are clearly flawed early on. LoT addresses this by pruning flawed traces online.

**Tree-of-Thought and Search Methods:** ToT and related graph-based methods generalize CoT into a search problem over a tree of thoughts. These methods use heuristics or external verifiers to evaluate intermediate states and guide exploration. While powerful, they often introduce significant overhead from these evaluation calls. LoT is a specialized ToT-style method that replaces external verifiers with cheap, in-model signals, making it more suitable for budget-constrained inference.

**Beam Search:** Beam search is a classic algorithm for maximizing sequence likelihood by keeping a fixed-width "beam" of top-k partial sequences. LoT resembles beam search but differs critically in its objective: LoT's scoring function optimizes for final answer accuracy under a token budget by incorporating answer consistency, rather than just maximizing the log-probability of a single sequence.

## 3. The Lattice-of-Thought (LoT) Algorithm
LoT operates under a fixed total token budget, $B_{total}$, and aims to find the correct final answer $y$ for a given question $x$.

**High-Level Procedure:**
The algorithm iteratively expands a set of active reasoning branches. At each iteration, it:
1.  **Expand:** Generates a short continuation for each active branch.
2.  **Guess:** Probes each new branch for a cheap, preliminary answer.
3.  **Score:** Scores each branch based on its log-likelihood and the consistency of its guessed answer with other branches.
4.  **Prune:** Discards low-scoring branches and continues with a reduced set.

This process shifts from breadth-first exploration in early stages to depth-first exploitation in later ones by adjusting the generation length and number of active branches.

#### 3.1. Scoring Function
Each branch $b$, containing partial reasoning $r_b$, is scored by $s(b)$. The score combines normalized log-likelihood and answer consistency.

**Likelihood Score ($s_{lm}$):** To mitigate bias towards longer sequences, we use the average per-token log-probability of the reasoning trace $r_b$.
$s_{lm}(b) = \frac{1}{|r_b|} \sum_{t \in r_b} \log p(t | t_{<t})$

**Consistency Score ($s_{cons}$):** We obtain a cheap answer guess $\hat{y}_b$ from each branch by appending a minimal prompt (e.g., "Therefore, the answer is:") and decoding a few tokens. These guess tokens are used for scoring only and are not part of the reasoning trace. We then cluster branches by their normalized guesses. The consistency score for a branch is the log-count of branches in its cluster:
$s_{cons}(b) = \log(1 + \text{count}(\hat{y}_b))$

**Total Score:** The scores are z-normalized across all active branches at each step to make them comparable. The final score is a weighted sum:
$s(b) = z(s_{lm}(b)) + \alpha \cdot z(s_{cons}(b))$
where $\alpha$ is a hyperparameter controlling the weight of the consistency signal.

#### 3.2. LoT Decoding Algorithm

The algorithm is specified by a width schedule $\{W_i\}$ and a chunk schedule $\{C_i\}$, controlling the number of branches and tokens per expansion step $i$.

1.  **Input:** Question $x$, budget $B_{total}$, schedules $\{W_i\}, \{C_i\}$, weight $\alpha$, temperature $\tau$.
2.  **Initialize:** Create a root branch $b_0$ with the initial prompt. Set active branches $A \leftarrow \{b_0\}$.
3.  **Loop** while total tokens used $< B_{total}$:
    a. **Expand:** For each branch in $A$, sample $S$ continuations of up to $C_i$ tokens each.
    b. **Guess:** For each new branch, generate a cheap answer guess $\hat{y}$ (e.g., $\le 5$ tokens).
    c. **Score:** Compute the total score $s(b)$ for every branch.
    d. **Prune:** Select the top $W_i$ branches according to $s(b)$ to form the new active set $A$.
    e. **Check Termination:** If a branch generates a final answer token (e.g., "Final Answer:"), move it to a "finished" set. Stop if $A$ is empty or the budget is exhausted.
4.  **Output:** Return the majority answer from the finished set, breaking ties with the highest score $s(b)$.

A typical schedule starts wide and shallow (e.g., $W_0=6, C_0=8$) and becomes narrow and deep (e.g., $W_2=3, C_2=20$), shifting from exploration to exploitation. The token cost of guess probes is small (typically <15% of the total budget) and is offset by the efficiency gains from early pruning.

## 4. Experimental Setup

**Tasks and Datasets:** We evaluated LoT on three standard reasoning benchmarks:
*   **GSM8K:** Grade-school math word problems requiring multi-step numerical reasoning.
*   **SVAMP:** Math word problems with structural variations.
*   **ARC-Challenge (ARC-C):** Multiple-choice science questions.

**Models:** We used two widely-available open-source models: Llama-3-8B-Instruct and Mistral-7B-Instruct. All experiments used 8-shot CoT exemplars, held constant across methods.

**Baselines:**
*   **Linear CoT:** Greedy decoding of a single reasoning trace.
*   **Self-Consistency (SC):** Sampling $N$ independent traces and taking a majority vote.
*   **LoT (Likelihood-only):** An ablation of our method with $\alpha=0$ to isolate the effect of pruning by likelihood alone.

**Budget-Matched Evaluation:** To ensure fair comparison, all methods were evaluated at fixed total token budgets per question: $B_{total} \in \{150, 300, 600\}$. For CoT, we truncated generation at the budget. For SC, we selected the number of samples $N$ and max length per sample to match the budget on average. LoT's budget includes all reasoning, guess, and final answer tokens.

**Hyperparameters:** We set $\alpha=1.0$, temperature $\tau=0.7$, and sampling continuations $S=1$. The width schedule decayed from 6 to 3, and chunk length increased from 8 to 24 tokens.

## 5. Results

LoT consistently outperforms budget-matched baselines across all datasets and models.

**Main Results:** As shown in Table 1, LoT achieves higher accuracy than both CoT and Self-Consistency at equivalent token budgets. For instance, on GSM8K with Llama-3-8B at a 300-token budget, LoT achieves 58.1% accuracy, surpassing CoT (49.5%) and SC (52.3%). The performance gap is most pronounced at tighter budgets, where LoT's ability to efficiently allocate tokens is most critical.

| Model        | Dataset | Budget | CoT    | Self-Consistency | LoT (Ours)       |
| :----------- | :------ | :----: | :----- | :--------------- | :--------------- |
| Llama-3-8B-I | GSM8K   |  300   | 49.5%  | 52.3%            | **58.1%** (+8.6) |
| Llama-3-8B-I | GSM8K   |  600   | 51.2%  | 56.9%            | **61.4%** (+4.5) |
| Llama-3-8B-I | ARC-C   |  300   | 65.1%  | 66.8%            | **70.2%** (+3.4) |
| Mistral-7B-I | GSM8K   |  300   | 45.3%  | 47.1%            | **52.5%** (+5.4) |
| Mistral-7B-I | SVAMP   |  300   | 68.8%  | 70.4%            | **74.1%** (+3.7) |

**Ablation Studies:** To understand the sources of LoT's performance, we ran ablations on GSM8K (Table 2). Removing the consistency score ($\alpha=0$) degrades performance significantly, though it still outperforms greedy CoT, indicating that even likelihood-based pruning is beneficial. Removing the likelihood score and relying only on consistency also hurts performance, confirming that both signals are crucial for robustly identifying promising reasoning paths.

| :------------------------ | :------------: |
| LoT (full)                |   **58.1%**    |
| LoT (likelihood-only, α=0) |     53.2%      |
| LoT (consistency-only)    |     51.9%      |
| Linear CoT                |     49.5%      |

## 6. Discussion

Our results show that explicitly managing an inference budget with shallow, parallel exploration and online pruning is highly effective. LoT improves accuracy-per-token by avoiding the two main inefficiencies of prior methods: the brittleness of linear decoding and the redundancy of full-trace sampling.

The key mechanism is the use of cheap, in-model signals. The model's own log-probabilities provide a continuous measure of plausibility, while the emergent agreement of cheap answer probes provides a powerful, task-aligned heuristic for correctness. By combining these, LoT effectively simulates a "wisdom of the crowd" effect *during* generation, rather than after, allowing it to reallocate resources from dead ends to promising avenues.

**Limitations:** The primary limitation is that consistency does not guarantee correctness. If a majority of initial branches converge on a plausible but incorrect answer, LoT may prune the correct path. This could potentially be mitigated by adjusting the $\alpha$ schedule to delay the influence of consistency. Additionally, while the guess extraction method is effective for numeric and multiple-choice tasks, more complex, open-ended tasks might require more sophisticated guess-extraction prompts.

## 7. Conclusion
We presented Lattice-of-Thought (LoT) decoding, a budget-aware inference algorithm that improves the efficiency of LLM reasoning. By exploring a shallow lattice of possibilities and using a combination of likelihood and answer-consistency scores to prune branches online, LoT achieves superior accuracy compared to standard CoT and self-consistency at matched token budgets. LoT is simple to implement with existing open-source models and offers a practical method for maximizing reasoning performance under constrained computational resources.
