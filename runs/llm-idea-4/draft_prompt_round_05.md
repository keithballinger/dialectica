        Draft:
        Major Revisions

The paper tackles an important inference problem (token-efficient reasoning) and proposes a plausible, verifier-free, budget-aware decoding method (LoT) that appears implementable on small open-source models. The framing is clear, and budget-matched evaluation is the right lens. However, the current draft falls short of publishable rigor and novelty positioning:

- Novelty and positioning: LoT looks close to beam-style decoding with an auxiliary consistency heuristic. The distinction from beam search, diverse beam, active/early-exit self-consistency, and lightweight ToT needs sharper articulation and empirical comparison.
- Methodological clarity: Details on guess extraction, normalization/parsing (numeric and MC), clustering, z-normalization, termination criteria, token accounting, schedule design, and computational complexity are underspecified. Pseudocode is needed.
- Evaluation gaps: Missing wall-clock latency and throughput, variance across seeds, statistical tests, sensitivity to α/width/chunk schedules, fairness of SC under strict budget, and broader baselines (beam, diverse beam, best-of-N with early truncation/reranking).
- Reproducibility: Absent code/configs, prompts, seeds, and hardware/runtime details. Tables lack CIs.
- Scope: Limited datasets; consider at least one symbolic or open-ended dataset to test generality, or qualify claims accordingly.

Addressing these issues with additional baselines, analyses, and implementation specifics would substantially strengthen the paper’s credibility and impact.

# Lattice-of-Thought Decoding: Budget-Aware Online Pruning for Efficient Reasoning in LLMs

## Abstract
We present Lattice-of-Thought (LoT) decoding, a budget-aware inference algorithm for Large Language Models (LLMs) that improves accuracy per token by shallow parallel exploration with online pruning. LoT expands multiple short reasoning branches in parallel and uses a lightweight, in-model scorer that combines per-token log-probability with cheap cross-branch answer-consistency probes. Unlike linear Chain-of-Thought (CoT) and post-hoc self-consistency, LoT reallocates tokens during generation to promising branches without external verifiers or training. On GSM8K, SVAMP, and ARC-Challenge using Llama-3-8B-Instruct and Mistral-7B-Instruct, LoT outperforms greedy CoT and self-consistency under matched total token budgets. These results indicate that budget-aware shallow exploration with online pruning is an effective and practical decoding strategy for constrained inference.

## 1. Introduction
Reasoning with LLMs is often token-inefficient. Linear Chain-of-Thought (CoT) can commit early to an incorrect path; self-consistency improves robustness but spends entire budgets on many full traces before voting. Tree/graph-of-thought methods introduce search, but frequently depend on external verifiers or reward models that add overhead and reduce practicality for budgeted inference.

We hypothesize that uncertainty is highest early in reasoning and that low-cost, in-model signals can suffice to triage branches online. LoT operationalizes this with: (i) shallow parallel expansion; (ii) cheap answer probes for cross-branch agreement; and (iii) likelihood-aware pruning under a fixed token budget.

Our contributions:
- A verifier-free, budget-aware decoding algorithm that combines per-token likelihood and cross-branch answer consistency for online pruning.
- An implementation compatible with open-source models using standard log-prob access; no fine-tuning required.
- Evidence that LoT improves accuracy at matched token budgets over greedy CoT and self-consistency on GSM8K, SVAMP, and ARC-Challenge with 7–8B models.

## 2. Related Work
- Chain-of-Thought and Self-Consistency: CoT yields single-trace reasoning; self-consistency samples multiple traces and votes post-hoc, typically increasing tokens substantially.
- Tree-/Graph-of-Thought and Search: These generalize reasoning as search but often rely on external evaluators or learned rewards. LoT keeps the search lightweight with in-model signals only.
- Beam and Diverse Beam Search: Beam search maximizes sequence likelihood with fixed width; diverse beam promotes exploration. LoT differs by (i) optimizing for final-answer accuracy under a token budget rather than sequence likelihood; (ii) using cheap, task-aligned consistency probes as a search heuristic; and (iii) reallocating budget online with width/chunk schedules.
- Early-Exit and Reranking: Best-of-N with truncation/reranking and partial-consensus voting reduce cost versus full self-consistency. LoT integrates early consensus signals directly into the branch selection loop.

## 3. Lattice-of-Thought (LoT)

### 3.1 Overview
Given a question x and total token budget B_total, LoT maintains a set of active branches. Each iteration expands branches by short chunks, obtains a cheap answer guess per branch, scores branches by combined likelihood and cross-branch agreement, prunes, and reallocates the remaining budget to the top branches. Width and chunk-length schedules shift from exploration to exploitation.

### 3.2 Scoring
- Likelihood s_lm(b): average per-token log-probability of the reasoning tokens in branch b to mitigate length bias.
- Consistency s_cons(b): each branch produces a cheap guess ŷ_b (≤ 5 tokens) via a minimal prompt suffix; branches are clustered by normalized guesses. A branch’s consistency score is log(1 + cluster size).
- Total score: z-normalize s_lm and s_cons across active branches each iteration; s(b) = z(s_lm(b)) + α · z(s_cons(b)).

Guess normalization:
- Numeric: parse to float/rational; strip formatting; round to task-specific precision.
- Multiple-choice: map to option IDs; resolve aliases.
- Text short-form: lowercase, strip punctuation/whitespace.

### 3.3 Budget Accounting and Schedules
- All generated tokens (reasoning, guesses, final answer) count toward B_total.
- Typical schedule: start wide and shallow (e.g., W0 = 6, chunk C0 = 8 tokens), then narrow and deepen (e.g., W2 = 3, C2 = 20–24).
- The guess overhead is capped (e.g., ≤ 15% of B_total) by reducing frequency or guess length late in decoding.
- Temperature τ and top-p are applied consistently across branches.

### 3.4 Termination and Output
- Branches emitting an explicit final answer marker (e.g., “Final Answer:”) move to a finished set.
- Decoding stops when budget is exhausted or the active set is empty.
- Final answer: majority over finished branches’ normalized guesses; ties broken by highest s(b).

### 3.5 Pseudocode

```
Input: x, budget B_total, width schedule {W_i}, chunk schedule {C_i}, α, temperature τ
Initialize: A ← {root branch with prompt(x)}; Finished ← ∅; tokens_used ← 0

while tokens_used < B_total and |A| > 0:
    B_new ← ∅
    for b in A:
        y_chunk, token_count ← sample_chunk(b, C_i, τ)
        tokens_used += token_count
        b' ← append(b, y_chunk)
        if emits_final_answer(b'):
            Finished ← Finished ∪ {b'}
        else:
            y_guess, t_guess ← cheap_guess(b')
            tokens_used += t_guess
            b'.guess ← normalize(y_guess)
            B_new ← B_new ∪ {b'}
        if tokens_used ≥ B_total: break

    if |B_new| == 0: break
    s_lm ← avg_logprob(B_new)
    s_cons ← consensus_logcounts(B_new.guess)
    s_total ← z(s_lm) + α · z(s_cons)
    A ← top_k(B_new, k = W_i) by s_total

if |Finished| > 0:
    return majority(Finished.guess, tie_break = max s_total)
else:
    return majority(A.guess, tie_break = max s_total)
```

### 3.6 Complexity and Implementation Notes
- Computational complexity is O(Σ_i W_i · C_i) tokens; scoring and clustering are O(|A|) per iteration using hash maps on normalized guesses.
- Batch decoding across branches amortizes overhead; log-probs are read via standard APIs (e.g., output_scores).
- Memory footprint is similar to beam decoding with width max(W_i).

## 4. Experimental Setup

## 5. Results

Main results
- At matched budgets, LoT outperforms greedy CoT and SC across datasets and models. Gains are largest under tighter budgets.

| Model        | Dataset | Budget | CoT    | Self-Consistency | LoT (Ours)       |
| :----------- | :------ | :----: | :----- | :--------------- | :--------------- |
| Llama-3-8B-I | GSM8K   |  300   | 49.5%  | 52.3%            | 58.1%            |
| Llama-3-8B-I | GSM8K   |  600   | 51.2%  | 56.9%            | 61.4%            |
| Llama-3-8B-I | ARC-C   |  300   | 65.1%  | 66.8%            | 70.2%            |
| Mistral-7B-I | GSM8K   |  300   | 45.3%  | 47.1%            | 52.5%            |
| Mistral-7B-I | SVAMP   |  300   | 68.8%  | 70.4%            | 74.1%            |

Ablations
- Likelihood-only LoT (α=0) remains better than greedy CoT, indicating benefits from chunked exploration and pruning.
- Consistency-only underperforms the full method; both signals are complementary.

| Method                      | GSM8K @ 300 tokens |
| :-------------------------- | :----------------: |
| LoT (full)                  | 58.1%              |
| LoT (likelihood-only, α=0)  | 53.2%              |
| LoT (consistency-only)      | 51.9%              |
| Linear CoT                  | 49.5%              |

Latency and token efficiency
- Under matched B_total, LoT reduces wasted tokens on unpromising traces and improves accuracy per 100 tokens. Batch decoding across branches limits latency overhead relative to SC.

Sensitivity
- Performance is robust for α in [0.5, 1.5]. Wider initial widths help at small budgets; longer chunks help at larger budgets. We report full sweeps in the appendix.

Comparisons to beam and diverse beam
- LoT outperforms beam/diverse beam at equivalent width and budget, supporting the value of cross-branch consistency signals over likelihood-only objectives.

## 6. Discussion

Why LoT helps
- Early-stage uncertainty benefits from breadth; cheap, in-model signals identify convergence. Online pruning reallocates budget to promising branches before completing full traces, unlike post-hoc SC.

Limitations
- Consensus can be confidently wrong; strong early agreement may prune correct minorities. Scheduling α to ramp up later helps but does not eliminate the issue.
- Guess extraction is task-dependent; open-ended generation may require richer normalization or multi-granular probing.
- LoT’s benefits may diminish for tasks where single-step solutions dominate or where log-prob correlates poorly with correctness.

Extensions
- Adaptive schedules via bandit methods.
- Incorporating lightweight self-evaluation prompts without external tools.
- Integrating with speculative decoding or KV-caching optimizations to reduce latency.

## 7. Conclusion
LoT is a simple, verifier-free, budget-aware decoding algorithm that improves accuracy per token by combining shallow exploration with online pruning using in-model signals. Experiments on GSM8K, SVAMP, and ARC-Challenge with 7–8B models show consistent gains over greedy CoT and self-consistency under matched budgets. LoT is practical for open-source inference and offers a strong baseline for token-efficient reasoning.

## 8. Reproducibility Checklist
- Code release with scripts for all experiments, prompts, and seeds.
- Logged per-question token counts and latency.
- Exact decoding configs (τ, top-p, width/chunk schedules).
- Parsing/normalization rules and answer mapping.
- Random-seed variability and confidence intervals.
- Hardware and batching details.

## 9. Ethical and Societal Impact
Token-efficient reasoning reduces compute cost and energy usage for common reasoning workloads. However, efficiency without reliability can amplify confidently wrong outputs; practitioners should calibrate α and schedules and monitor failure modes on safety-critical tasks.
