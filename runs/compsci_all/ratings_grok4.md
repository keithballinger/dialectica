2) Score: 9/10 novelty, 10/10 falsifiability, 9/10 feasibility — Entropy-guided adaptive precision offers a fresh per-token uncertainty-driven approach to mixed-precision inference, falsifiable through throughput and accuracy comparisons on corpora, and feasible with minor implementation efforts on small models.

3) Score: 8/10 novelty, 9/10 falsifiability, 10/10 feasibility — Predictive low-rank KV forecasting builds on existing compression but adds novel dynamical modeling, with a solid falsification via long-context benchmarks on models like Mistral, easily feasible within constraints.

4) Score: 9/10 novelty, 9/10 falsifiability, 9/10 feasibility — Soft-prefix KV reuse via alignment extends caching innovatively to approximate matches, falsifiable by latency and accuracy tests on prefixed prompts, feasible but requiring careful index building for small models.

5) Score: 8/10 novelty, 10/10 falsifiability, 10/10 feasibility — Target-entropy decoding proposes a new closed-loop control for sampling, directly falsifiable on QA and writing tasks with repetition metrics, highly feasible using existing decoding frameworks on open models.

6) Score: 9/10 novelty, 9/10 falsifiability, 9/10 feasibility — Error-correcting speculative decoding via branch voting innovates on fusion beyond simple acceptance, falsifiable under matched compute with perplexity and acceptance rates, feasible though needing robust drafter implementation.

7) Score: 8/10 novelty, 10/10 falsifiability, 10/10 feasibility — Evidence-aligned logit projection provides a soft constraint distinct from hard methods, falsifiable on factual QA with projection strength sweeps, straightforward to implement on small retrieval-augmented models.

8) Score: 9/10 novelty, 9/10 falsifiability, 9/10 feasibility — Semantic centroid attention introduces online clustering for attention reduction, falsifiable via speed-accuracy trade-offs on long-context tasks, feasible but with potential overhead from streaming clustering.

9) Score: 9/10 novelty, 9/10 falsifiability, 8/10 feasibility — Meta-decoding controller adaptively selects methods per step, a novel policy-based approach, falsifiable through task score comparisons and generalization tests, feasible yet requiring training of the controller on small models.

10) Score: 8/10 novelty, 10/10 falsifiability, 10/10 feasibility — Attention pattern replay for repetitive structures offers a new acceleration tactic via detection and reuse, falsifiable on structured generation tasks with speedups, easily implemented on models handling lists or code.
