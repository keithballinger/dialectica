1) Score: 9/10 — This is a novel synthesis of signal processing and LLM inference that is clearly falsifiable and highly feasible to implement.
2) Score: 7/10 — The core idea is novel but demonstrating a practical speedup is a major feasibility risk due to hardware/kernel limitations with dynamic precision.
3) Score: 9/10 — A novel, principled approach to the critical KV cache problem with a clear, feasible validation plan on long-context tasks.
4) Score: 8/10 — This is a highly practical and novel extension of prefix caching that is straightforward to implement and validate.
5) Score: 9/10 — Reframing decoding as a control problem is an elegant, novel, and highly feasible idea with a direct path to falsification.
6) Score: 10/10 — Applying a coding-theoretic frame to speculative decoding is a highly novel, feasible, and falsifiable idea with high potential impact.
7) Score: 8/10 — This introduces a novel and feasible soft-constraint mechanism to address the critical problem of factual consistency in generation.
8) Score: 6/10 — A novel attention approximation, but the overhead of online clustering presents a significant feasibility risk to achieving a net speedup.
9) Score: 8/10 — This is a highly novel meta-learning approach to decoding, though the training and generalization of the controller pose moderate feasibility challenges.
10) Score: 7/10 — A clever and novel optimization, but its limited applicability to repetitive structures may constrain its overall impact for a top journal.
