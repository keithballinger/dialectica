1) Score: 9/10 — Highly novel phase-transition prediction in algorithmic pricing, falsifiable via Python Q-learning simulations, feasible under game theory-econ synthesis constraints.
2) Score: 8/10 — Novel liquidity-centrality metric for shock propagation, falsifiable with agent-based network sims in Python, aligns well with constraints but moderately complex.
3) Score: 9/10 — Innovative attention-based threshold for auction revenue, directly falsifiable through Python simulations of bounded agents, highly feasible and publishable.
4) Score: 8/10 — Fresh noise threshold in matching markets, falsifiable via Bayesian sims in Python, feasible but requires careful noise parameterization for journal quality.
5) Score: 9/10 — Novel cyclic dynamics in carbon offsets, falsifiable with strategic simulation in Python, strong synthesis of game theory and econ for high publishability.
6) Score: 8/10 — Original oscillation prediction in surge pricing, falsifiable via Python demand-supply models, feasible though oscillation detection may need refined spectral analysis.
7) Score: 9/10 — Innovative MEV-deterrence cycles in DeFi, falsifiable with AMM simulations in Python, highly novel and aligned with constraints for leading journal.
8) Score: 8/10 — Creative obfuscation equilibria in data markets, falsifiable through Bayesian Python sims, feasible but mixed strategies add computational intensity.
9) Score: 9/10 — Novel hysteresis in capacity-punished pricing, falsifiable via dynamic game sims in Python, excellent feasibility and potential for econ journal publication.
10) Score: 9/10 — Sharp threshold for P2P insurance sustainability, falsifiable with network simulations in Python, highly novel synthesis meeting all constraints effectively.
