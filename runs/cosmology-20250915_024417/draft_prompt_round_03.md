        Draft:
        Major Revisions

The paper presents a novel and compelling synthesis of repeated game theory and DeFi microstructure to analyze dynamic fee-setting. The core theoretical idea—that trigger strategies can deter MEV—is sound, and the simulation-based approach with clear falsification criteria is a significant strength. However, the manuscript requires major revisions before it can be considered for publication.

1.  **Conceptual Precision of "Cycles":** The paper conflates stochastically-triggered regime switching with endogenous limit cycles. The trigger-strategy model produces periods of low fees punctuated by high-fee punishment phases, driven by exogenous shocks to the price process. This is not a "limit cycle" in the formal sense. This distinction must be clarified throughout the paper to avoid misrepresenting the dynamic process.
2.  **Arbitrageur Behavior Model:** There is a critical disconnect between the theoretical model and the simulation. The deterrence condition (G ≤ D) assumes a forward-looking arbitrageur who weighs future punishment against current gains. The simulated arbitrageur is myopic, entering whenever the single-period expected profit is positive. While the dynamic fee policy *does* influence the myopic agent's incentives, the paper incorrectly implies the simulated agent is solving the full dynamic game. This must be explicitly stated and justified as a behavioral simplification.
3.  **Simulation Accuracy:** The LVR calculation in the provided Python code is incorrect. `LVR += max(pre_value - post_value + gas_cost, 0.0)` incorrectly adds the arbitrageur's gas cost to the LP's loss. LVR is the adverse selection cost imposed on the LP, which is equivalent to the arbitrageur's gross profit before costs. This error undermines the quantitative results and must be corrected. The arbitrage profit calculation for the entry decision is also an imprecise proxy; a more accurate calculation based on the expected change in portfolio value should be used.

The proposed research direction is excellent, but these foundational issues in the execution and description of the simulation and its connection to the theory must be rectified.

# MEV-Deterrence via Endogenous AMM Fees in a Repeated Game: Regime-Switching Equilibria and Improved LP Returns

## Abstract

We study a repeated game between an automated market maker (AMM) liquidity provider (LP) who sets the trading fee and latency-constrained arbitrageurs who exploit price discrepancies (MEV). We model noise-trader order flow as fee-elastic and arbitrage profit as dependent on price gaps, fees, latency, and gas costs. We show that dynamic, state-contingent fee policies can deter arbitrage entry. For forward-looking arbitrageurs, trigger strategies can form a subgame-perfect equilibrium when LPs are sufficiently patient. For myopic arbitrageurs, these policies shape incentives to reduce the frequency of exploitation. The equilibrium path exhibits endogenous regime switching: low fees attract benign flow but can enable profitable arbitrage, which triggers a temporary high-fee punishment phase, after which fees revert. Python simulations of a constant-product AMM with stochastic external prices and order flow confirm that (i) adaptive fees induce fee regimes that switch in response to market conditions and (ii) they improve LP risk-adjusted returns relative to fixed fees across a wide range of latencies and gas costs. We provide falsifiable predictions and open-source simulation code.

## 1. Introduction

Decentralized exchanges (DEXs) based on constant-function market makers (CFMMs) typically use a fixed ad valorem fee. This design exposes liquidity providers (LPs) to adverse selection from arbitrageurs who trade to align the AMM's price with external market prices, extracting what is known as loss-versus-rebalancing (LVR). This arbitrage is a dominant form of Maximal Extractable Value (MEV), where execution is shaped by latency, transaction costs (gas), and mempool dynamics.

While prior work quantifies LVR under fixed fees, the strategic role of fees in deterring MEV has been underexplored. We synthesize the theory of entry-deterrence in repeated games with DeFi microstructure by endogenizing the AMM fee. Our central thesis is that LPs can condition fees on observed arbitrage to manipulate the expected cost and profitability of entry. The optimal policy is not fixed but dynamic: phases of low fees attract benign volume, but large price movements can trigger profitable arbitrage opportunities. In response, the LP initiates a temporary "punishment" phase of high fees to render arbitrage unprofitable, subsequently reverting to lower fees.

**Contributions:**
- A repeated-game model of a strategic LP (fee-setter) and an arbitrageur (entrant) with fee-elastic benign flow and latency- and gas-sensitive arbitrage.
- A deterrence condition for when trigger-fee strategies can sustain a no-entry path as a subgame-perfect equilibrium against a forward-looking arbitrageur.
- The prediction of endogenous, stochastic regime-switching in fee policies as the typical equilibrium outcome.
- A Python simulation framework that validates the model's predictions, showing that adaptive fees improve LP Sharpe ratios compared to optimal fixed fees and providing clear falsification criteria.

## 2. Model

### 2.1. Market Setup

-   **AMM:** A constant product market maker ($x \cdot y = k$) with reserves $x$ and $y$ of two assets. The LP sets an ad valorem fee $f_t \in [0, f_{max}]$ at each discrete time step (block) $t$. The internal AMM price is $p_t = y_t/x_t$.
-   **External Price:** A reference price $S_t$ follows a stochastic process (e.g., geometric Brownian motion with jumps).
-   **Noise Traders:** Benign trading volume arrives as a Poisson process with fee-elastic intensity $\lambda(f_t) = \lambda_0 \exp(-\epsilon f_t)$, where $\epsilon$ is the elasticity parameter. Trade sizes are stochastic.
-   **Arbitrageur:** A representative arbitrageur observes $S_t$ with latency $L$ and pays a gas cost $c_g$ per transaction. They enter if the expected profit from aligning the AMM price $p_t$ with the latency-adjusted external price $S_{t-L}$ is positive, net of fees and gas.

### 2.2. The Repeated Game

The interaction is an infinite-horizon repeated game with discount factor $\delta \in (0,1)$.

**Stage Game (at block t):**
1.  The LP chooses fee $f_t$ based on the public history of trades and fees.
2.  Nature determines noise trades and the external price $S_t$.
3.  The arbitrageur observes the price gap and chooses an action $a_t \in \{0, 1\}$ (no-entry/entry). Entry occurs only if profitable.

**Payoffs:**
-   **LP Payoff:** $\pi_{L,t}(f_t, a_t) = \text{FeeRevenue}_t(f_t) - \text{LVR}_t(f_t, a_t)$. Fee revenue depends on both noise flow and any arbitrage flow. LVR is the loss from adverse selection, equal to the arbitrageur's gross profit.
-   **Arbitrageur Payoff:** $\pi_{A,t}(f_t, a_t) = a_t \cdot \max\{\Pi_{A,t}(f_t) - c_g, 0\}$, where $\Pi_{A,t}$ is the gross profit from the optimal arbitrage trade.

### 2.3. Equilibrium and Deterrence

We consider trigger strategies for the LP, contingent on observed arbitrage:
-   **Strategy:** Set a low fee $f_L$ (cooperation phase). If arbitrage is detected, switch to a high fee $f_H$ for a punishment period of $T$ blocks. After $T$ blocks, revert to $f_L$.

**Deterrence of a Forward-Looking Arbitrageur:**
Let $\Pi_A(f)$ be the expected gross arbitrage profit when the fee is $f$. Assume $\Pi_A(f_H) - c_g \le 0$ (high fee makes arbitrage unprofitable) and $\Pi_A(f_L) - c_g > 0$ (low fee permits it). A forward-looking arbitrageur will refrain from entering at fee $f_L$ if the one-shot gain from deviation is less than or equal to the discounted future loss from punishment.

-   One-shot deviation gain: $G = \Pi_A(f_L) - c_g$
-   Discounted punishment loss: $D = \sum_{i=1}^{T} \delta^i (\Pi_A(f_L) - \Pi_A(f_H))$

Deterrence is a subgame-perfect equilibrium (SPE) if $G \le D$. This condition holds if the LP is patient (high $\delta$) and the punishment ($f_H$, $T$) is sufficiently severe. LP credibility requires that executing the punishment is optimal, which holds if the reduction in future LVR outweighs the temporary loss of fee-elastic noise flow.

**Equilibrium with Myopic Arbitrageurs:**
While the SPE concept assumes full rationality, we test the policy's effectiveness against a more realistic, computationally bounded agent. Our simulation uses a **myopic arbitrageur** who enters if and only if the current, single-period expected profit is positive: $\mathbb{E}[\Pi_{A,t}(f_t) - c_g] > 0$. The LP's trigger strategy remains effective by directly manipulating this single-period profit calculation, making arbitrage unprofitable during punishment phases.

**Stochastic Regime Switching:**
Because the price process $S_t$ is stochastic, large price jumps can create arbitrage opportunities so profitable that $\Pi_{A,t}(f_L) - c_g > 0$ even if this is not true in expectation. These random events will trigger the punishment phase. Consequently, the equilibrium path does not feature a constant fee but rather **stochastic switching between low-fee (cooperative) and high-fee (punishment) regimes**.

## 3. Simulation Study

We build a Python simulation to test the performance of adaptive fee policies against fixed-fee baselines.

### 3.1. Simulation Design

-   **Fee Policies:**
    1.  **Fixed:** $f_t = \bar{f}$ (testing 5, 30, 100 bps).
    2.  **Trigger:** $f_L = 10$ bps, $f_H = 100$ bps, punishment length $T \in \{10, 50, 200\}$.
    3.  **Continuous:** $f_{t+1} = \text{clip}[f_t + \eta (\text{LVR}_{\text{window}, t} - \tau)]$, an adaptive policy that adjusts the fee based on a moving average of recent LVR.
-   **Environment:**
    -   External Price: Geometric Brownian motion with compound Poisson jumps.
    -   Noise Flow: Poisson arrivals with exponential fee elasticity ($\epsilon$).
    -   Arbitrageur: Myopic agent with latency $L$ and gas cost $c_g$. Computes expected profit of the optimal trade against $S_{t-L}$ and executes if it exceeds $c_g$.
-   **Metrics:**
    -   **LP Performance:** Sharpe ratio of portfolio value, total fee revenue, total LVR.
    -   **Market Quality:** Share of volume from benign flow, volatility of AMM price.
    -   **Fee Dynamics:** Autocorrelation function and power spectral density of the fee time series.

### 3.2. Hypotheses and Falsification Criteria

-   **H1 (Regime Switching):** The fee series under adaptive policies will exhibit significant autocorrelation and low-frequency power, consistent with regime switching, and reject a white-noise null hypothesis.
-   **H2 (LP Returns):** The Sharpe ratio for LPs under an optimized adaptive policy will be higher than that of the best-performing fixed-fee policy across a majority of tested parameter environments.

The theory is considered **falsified** if H1 or H2 are rejected by the simulation evidence.

## 4. Discussion

Our work synthesizes entry-deterrence theory with market microstructure, casting the LP's fee-setting problem as a dynamic control problem. The trigger strategies we analyze are simple, public commitment devices. Their efficacy hinges on the trade-off between attracting fee-elastic benign flow and deterring adverse selection. Because price movements are stochastic, perfect deterrence is impossible; the model predicts that arbitrage "eruptions" will occasionally occur, triggering the high-fee punishment phase and creating observable, state-contingent fee dynamics.

These findings have direct implications for DEX design. Protocols can implement public, rule-based fee controllers that condition on observable proxies for arbitrage, such as large, rapid price realignments. Such mechanisms could systemically improve LP returns without resorting to complex, opaque, or discriminatory fee structures. Our simulation results, which show improved risk-adjusted returns, provide quantitative support for this design direction.

## 5. Limitations

Our model relies on several abstractions. We model a single, representative LP and arbitrageur, whereas real markets feature heterogeneous agents and complex auction dynamics for transaction ordering (e.g., MEV-Boost). The noise-trader model is stylized, and we do not consider active inventory management by LPs. Finally, the ability to change fees rapidly and credibly depends on protocol governance and technical constraints. Future work should aim to calibrate model parameters to on-chain data to provide more precise quantitative guidance.

## 6. Conclusion

We model endogenous AMM fees as a strategic instrument to deter MEV. Using a repeated game framework, we show that adaptive fee policies based on trigger strategies lead to equilibria with stochastic fee regimes. Our simulations validate that these dynamic policies can significantly improve LP risk-adjusted returns compared to optimal fixed fees under a range of market conditions. This work provides a theoretical foundation and a practical design path for more robust and profitable AMMs.
