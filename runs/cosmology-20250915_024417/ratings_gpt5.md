1) Score: 8/10 — Minor Revisions: Novel phase-transition claim on transparency–learning interaction is testable with Python RL price games and likely feasible, but must differentiate clearly from existing algorithmic collusion results.
2) Score: 7/10 — Major Revisions: The liquidity-adjusted centrality concept is intriguing and testable with ABM bargaining sims, but theoretical identification and robustness across network structures are uncertain and may limit publishability.
3) Score: 8/10 — Minor Revisions: Introducing attention-driven menu complexity thresholds is novel and falsifiable with bounded-rationality auction sims, though ties to canonical revenue equivalence need sharper theoretical anchoring.
4) Score: 7/10 — Minor Revisions: The wage compression threshold from noisy ratings is plausible, easy to simulate, and policy-relevant, but novelty over established signal-noise pooling results must be demonstrated.
5) Score: 8/10 — Minor Revisions: Strategic verification cycles in offsets are a fresh synthesis with clear spectral falsification in Python, yet empirical plausibility and parameter discipline require careful justification.
6) Score: 8/10 — Minor Revisions: Modeling surge pricing as Stackelberg commitment predicting oscillations is novel and simulatable with congestion dynamics, but sensitivity to behavioral frictions needs mapping.
7) Score: 9/10 — Publish: High novelty and clear falsifiability using DeFi AMM simulations make the cyclical fee–MEV deterrence mechanism both feasible and impactful for the subfield.
8) Score: 7/10 — Major Revisions: Obfuscation in data markets is timely and testable via Bayesian buyer–seller sims, but mixed-strategy existence and distinctiveness from classic obfuscation IO need rigorous treatment.
9) Score: 8/10 — Minor Revisions: Capacity-as-punishment yielding bistability and hysteresis is a strong game-theoretic–IO synthesis with feasible dynamic simulations, though distinguishing from known capacity-commitment models is essential.
10) Score: 7/10 — Minor Revisions: The reciprocity–audit threshold in P2P insurance integrates repeated games and networks with clear falsification via agent-based sims, but external validity and identification of threshold sharpness require work.
