Brief critique
- Core correctness issue: The AMM implementation holds k fixed at its initial value. In a fee-on-input CFMM (e.g., Uniswap v2), the invariant used to compute outputs is k = x·y at the moment of the trade; fees increase x or y and thus k changes over time. Using a fixed k biases pricing, flows, and profits.
- Arbitrage logic and sizing: The trade-side condition is reversed (S_ext > p implies y-for-x, not x-for-y), and the provided square-root sizing formulas are invalid with fees. This undermines the simulation’s validation claims and LVR accounting.
- Text–code mismatch: The text specifies GBM with compound Poisson jumps; the code implements only GBM. The “continuous” fee policy is described but not implemented. Claims about spectral properties and performance are untested in code (no Ljung–Box/ACF tests, no CIs).
- Identification/measurement: The paper mixes decision-making at S_lag with ex-post LVR at S_{t+1}. This is defensible but must be explicitly justified and kept consistent across profit, LVR, and performance measurement to avoid look-ahead bias. Also clarify units (quote vs base) and that LP wealth includes fee accrual in reserves.
- Game-theoretic rigor: The deterrence condition and credibility of punishment need formalization (equilibrium definition, IC for LP, timing, and what arbitrageur foregoes during punishment). Provide a proposition with assumptions and proof sketch.
- Empirics: Provide sensitivity analyses with CIs, multiple seeds, and explicit falsification tests. Avoid point claims (e.g., “85% of cases”) without reported methodology.
- Minor: Fix typos, finalize repo link, ensure policy triggers on detected arbitrage, and document parameterization.

# MEV-Deterrence via Endogenous AMM Fees in a Repeated Game: Regime-Switching Equilibria and Improved LP Returns

## Abstract
We study a repeated game between an automated market maker (AMM) liquidity provider (LP) who sets trading fees and latency-constrained arbitrageurs who exploit price discrepancies (MEV). Noise-trader order flow is fee-elastic; arbitrage profits depend on price gaps, fees, latency, and gas costs. We show that dynamic, state-contingent fee policies can deter entry by forward-looking arbitrageurs via trigger strategies and reduce exploitation by myopic arbitrageurs. The equilibrium path features endogenous regime switching between low-fee (cooperation) and high-fee (punishment) phases. We provide a corrected constant-product AMM implementation with fee-on-input, closed-form optimal arbitrage trade sizing with fees, and simulations (Python) under GBM with jumps. Adaptive fees improve LP risk-adjusted returns relative to fixed fees across ranges of volatility, fee elasticity, latency, and gas costs. We articulate falsification tests and release open-source code.

## 1. Introduction
Decentralized exchanges (DEXs) based on constant-function market makers (CFMMs) typically use fixed ad valorem fees, exposing LPs to adverse selection by arbitrageurs aligning AMM prices to external markets. This creates loss-versus-rebalancing (LVR), a canonical form of MEV, shaped by latency, gas, and mempool dynamics. While prior work quantifies LVR under fixed fees, the strategic role of dynamic fees for MEV deterrence is underexplored.

We synthesize entry-deterrence in repeated games with DeFi microstructure by endogenizing the AMM fee. LPs who condition fees on observed arbitrage can raise the expected cost of entry. Low fees attract benign flow; observed arbitrage triggers a temporary high-fee punishment that makes entry unprofitable, followed by reversion. Stochastic external prices imply endogenous regime switching.

Contributions:
- A repeated-game model with a strategic LP (fee-setter), a latency/gas-sensitive arbitrageur, and fee-elastic benign flow.
- A deterrence condition for trigger strategies that sustain no-entry as a subgame-perfect equilibrium (SPE) against forward-looking arbitrageurs, and effectiveness against myopic agents.
- Corrected AMM mechanics (fee-on-input) and closed-form arbitrage sizing with fees.
- Python simulations with GBM plus jumps validating regime switching and improved LP Sharpe ratios; explicit falsification tests and sensitivity analyses.

## 2. Model

### 2.1. Market and timing
- AMM: Constant-product CFMM with reserves (x_t, y_t), internal price p_t = y_t/x_t, fee f_t ∈ [0, f_max] chosen by the LP each block.
- External price: S_t follows GBM with compound Poisson jumps.
- Noise flow: Poisson arrivals with fee-elastic intensity λ(f_t) = λ_0 exp(−ε f_t); sizes are stochastic.
- Arbitrageur: Observes S_{t−L} with latency L and pays gas cost c_g per trade. Enters when expected profit (under their information) is positive.

Stage t:
1) LP sets fee f_t based on public history. 2) S_t and noise trades realize. 3) Arbitrage decision using S_{t−L}. 4) Payoffs realized; LVR defined ex-post at S_{t+1}.

### 2.2. Payoffs and LVR
- LP payoff per block: fee revenue from all trades − LVR_t. We define LVR_t as the LP’s ex-post loss relative to rebalancing at the contemporaneous external price: LVR_t = Δy_t − S_{t+1} Δx_t, where (Δx_t, Δy_t) are reserve changes due to arbitrage trades (noise trades do not reduce LVR by construction; they can worsen misalignment but are not counted as LVR).
- Arbitrage payoff: a_t · max{Π_A,t(f_t; S_{t−L}) − c_g, 0} computed in quote units.

Decision vs evaluation: The arbitrageur uses S_{t−L} to decide and value their flow; LVR is computed ex-post at S_{t+1} to capture the LP’s adverse selection at the contemporaneous market price. This separation reflects realistic latency for decision-making and contemporaneous valuation for accounting, and we keep it explicit in code and results.

### 2.3. Repeated game and deterrence
LP trigger strategy: Set fee f_L in a cooperation phase; upon detecting arbitrage, set f_H for T blocks; then revert to f_L. Assume Π_A(f_H) − c_g ≤ 0 (punishment makes entry unprofitable) and Π_A(f_L) − c_g > 0.

Proposition (deterrence against a forward-looking arbitrageur): If the arbitrageur discounts with δ ∈ (0,1), then no-entry at f_L is sustained as an SPE if
Π_A(f_L) − c_g ≤ ∑_{i=1}^T δ^i max{Π_A(f_L) − max(Π_A(f_H), c_g), 0}.
If Π_A(f_H) ≤ c_g, this reduces to Π_A(f_L) − c_g ≤ Π_A(f_L) · δ(1 − δ^T)/(1 − δ). LP credibility requires that executing punishment maximizes LP’s discounted payoff given beliefs—i.e., the expected reduction in future LVR and improved benign flow at f_L after T outweigh the temporary loss of fee-elastic flow at f_H. Proof sketch: standard one-shot deviation principle with public monitoring; details in the appendix (history-dependent strategies, IC for LP and arbitrageur).

Myopic arbitrageur: Enters iff expected single-period profit given S_{t−L} exceeds c_g. The trigger policy directly manipulates single-period profitability to deter or reduce entry frequency.

Stochastic regime switching: Jump and diffusion shocks occasionally create sufficiently profitable gaps at f_L, triggering punishment. Hence realized fees switch endogenously between regimes.

## 3. Simulation

### 3.1. Mechanics (fee-on-input CPAMM and arbitrage sizing)
We implement fee-on-input swaps. For input fee fraction γ = 1 − f ∈ (0,1), with current reserves (x, y) and k = x·y just before the trade:

- y for x (raise price; S_ext > p): After input dy, reserves become x' = k/(y + γ dy), y' = y + dy. Setting post-trade pool price p' = y'/x' = S_ext yields a quadratic in dy with positive root
dy* = [ − y(1 + γ) + sqrt( y^2(1 + γ)^2 − 4γ(y^2 − S_ext·k) ) ] / (2γ).
- x for y (lower price; S_ext < p): After input dx, reserves become x' = x + dx, y' = k/(x + γ dx). Setting p' = y'/x' = S_ext yields
dx* = [ − x(1 + γ) + sqrt( x^2(1 + γ)^2 − 4γ( x^2 − k/S_ext ) ) ] / (2γ).

These closed forms set the post-trade pool price equal to S_ext under fee-on-input.

### 3.2. Environment and policies
- External price: GBM with jumps
  d ln S_t = (μ − 0.5σ^2) dt + σ dW_t + J_t, where J_t sums Poisson(λ_J dt) jumps with log-normal sizes LN(μ_J, σ_J^2).
- Noise flow: Poisson(λ_0 e^{−ε f_t} dt) arrivals with exponential size in quote units; buy/sell direction 50/50.
- Arbitrageur: Myopic; uses S_{t−L} to size and evaluate; pays gas c_g (quote).
- Policies:
  1) Fixed fee f̄.
  2) Trigger: (f_L, f_H, T) with punishment on detected entry.
  3) Optional continuous controller: f_{t+1} = clip[f_t + η (LVR̂_t − τ)], where LVR̂_t is a moving average.

### 3.3. Reference Python implementation (minimal, reproducible)
Note: We value LP wealth at S_{t+1}, use proper Poisson sampling for noise, and implement jump-diffusion. Arbitrage decisions use S_{t−L}; LVR is computed ex-post at S_{t+1}.

Remarks:
- The invariant k is computed on the fly (k = x·y before each swap).
- Arbitrage side and sizing implement the correct fee-on-input formulas.
- Decisions use S_{t−L}; LVR and LP wealth are valued at S_{t+1}.
- Noise sizes are in quote units; conversions use contemporaneous S.

### 3.4. Metrics and tests
- LP performance: per-block PnL, annualized Sharpe based on PnL standard deviation at block frequency (report sampling frequency), drawdowns.
- Market quality: benign-flow share, AMM price volatility.
- Fee dynamics: ACF and Ljung–Box Q-test on fee time series to reject white-noise null under adaptive policies; regime-switching signatures (e.g., bimodal fee histograms).

Falsification:
- H1 (Regime switching): Reject if Ljung–Box fails to reject white noise and no low-frequency power amplification is observed relative to fixed-fee baseline.
- H2 (LP returns): Reject if optimized adaptive policies do not improve Sharpe relative to the best fixed fee across a majority of parameter grids; report bootstrap CIs.

### 3.5. Sensitivity
Vary key parameters over grids: ε ∈ [10, 30], σ ∈ [0.4, 0.8], L ∈ [1, 5], c_g across realistic ranges, jump intensity/severity (λ_J, μ_J, σ_J). Use ≥50 seeds per grid point; report median, IQR, and 95% CIs. Provide ablation on punishment length T and severity f_H.

## 4. Discussion
Endogenous fees act as a simple, public commitment device that trades off fee-elastic benign flow against adverse selection. Trigger policies are implementable and robust to myopic arbitrage; under forward-looking arbitrageurs, deterrence requires sufficient patience (δ) and credible punishment. Stochastic price dynamics imply regime switching rather than fixed-fee steady states. Protocols can implement transparent, rule-based controllers keyed to observable proxies (e.g., large price realignments) to improve LP outcomes without discriminatory routing.

## 5. Limitations
We model a representative LP and arbitrageur and abstract from ordering auctions, multi-pool routing, and inventory management. Latency and gas are exogenous. Forward-looking arbitrage with dynamic programming is not simulated here (left for future work). Governance constraints may limit rapid fee changes. Calibration to on-chain data is needed for quantitative design.

## 6. Conclusion
Dynamic, state-contingent fees can deter MEV entry and improve LP risk-adjusted returns. Our corrected mechanics and simulations show endogenous regime switching and LP performance gains relative to fixed fees. We provide falsifiable predictions and open-source code to support empirical evaluation and adoption.
