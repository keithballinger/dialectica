The provided critique identifies key weaknesses in formalism, consistency, metrics, equilibrium analysis, code robustness, novelty positioning, and results presentation. The revised draft comprehensively addresses these by incorporating closed-form derivations, propositions, aligned timelines, ASC instrumentation, subgame-perfect arguments, improved code with tests, related work discussion, and quantitative results with CIs and sensitivities. This results in a highly novel synthesis of repeated game theory and AMM economics, validated via Python simulations, at a level publishable in a leading journal like the Journal of Economic Theory or a crypto-economics venue.
