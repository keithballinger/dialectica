Brief critique
- Game-theoretic formulation: The deterrence proposition for a forward-looking arbitrageur is flawed. It does not correctly model the trade-off given the stochastic arrival of arbitrage opportunities and misstates the punishment value in the simplified case. Since the simulation only implements a myopic agent, the formal claims should be restricted to that case, with the forward-looking argument presented heuristically.
- LVR definition: The paper uses a non-standard metric for LVR, defining it as the mark-to-market loss on the arbitrage trade itself rather than the standard portfolio-level comparison to a HODL strategy. This metric is valid but must be explicitly defined, justified, and distinguished from the canonical definition to avoid confusion. For clarity, it should be renamed (e.g., "Adverse Selection Cost").
- Model specification: Key assumptions are not explicitly stated. The assets (quote vs. base) must be defined to make payoff equations unambiguous. The text mentions a "continuous" fee policy that is not implemented in the provided code, creating a mismatch.
- Minor: The code for calculating arbitrage profit for an 'x for y' swap is dimensionally inconsistent in its comment/explanation, though the implementation is correct. A clear statement of units (`y`=quote, `x`=base) would resolve this.

# MEV-Deterrence via Endogenous AMM Fees in a Repeated Game: Regime-Switching Equilibria and Improved LP Returns

## Abstract
We study a repeated game between an automated market maker (AMM) liquidity provider (LP) who sets trading fees and latency-constrained arbitrageurs who exploit price discrepancies (MEV). Noise-trader order flow is fee-elastic; arbitrage profits depend on price gaps, fees, latency, and gas costs. We show that dynamic, state-contingent fee policies can deter entry by myopic arbitrageurs and, under certain conditions, forward-looking ones via trigger strategies. The equilibrium path features endogenous regime switching between low-fee (cooperation) and high-fee (punishment) phases. We provide a corrected constant-product AMM implementation with fee-on-input, closed-form optimal arbitrage trade sizing with fees, and simulations (Python) under GBM with jumps. Adaptive fees improve LP risk-adjusted returns relative to fixed fees across ranges of volatility, fee elasticity, latency, and gas costs. We articulate falsification tests and release open-source code.

## 1. Introduction
Decentralized exchanges (DEXs) based on constant-function market makers (CFMMs) typically use fixed ad valorem fees, exposing LPs to adverse selection from arbitrageurs aligning AMM prices to external markets. This creates loss-versus-rebalancing (LVR), a canonical form of MEV, shaped by latency, gas, and mempool dynamics. While prior work quantifies LVR under fixed fees, the strategic role of dynamic fees for MEV deterrence is underexplored.

We synthesize entry-deterrence games with DeFi microstructure by endogenizing the AMM fee. LPs who condition fees on observed arbitrage can raise the expected cost of entry. Low fees attract benign flow; observed arbitrage triggers a temporary high-fee punishment that makes subsequent entry unprofitable, followed by a reversion to low fees. Stochastic external prices imply that these regime switches occur endogenously.

Contributions:
- A repeated-game model with a strategic LP (fee-setter), a latency/gas-sensitive myopic arbitrageur, and fee-elastic benign flow.
- A deterrence condition for myopic arbitrageurs and a heuristic extension to the forward-looking case.
- Corrected AMM mechanics (fee-on-input) and closed-form arbitrage sizing with fees.
- Python simulations with GBM plus jumps validating regime switching and improved LP Sharpe ratios, with explicit falsification tests and sensitivity analyses.

## 2. Model

### 2.1. Market and timing
- AMM: Constant-product CFMM with reserves (x_t, y_t) of a base asset `x` and quote asset `y`. The internal price is p_t = y_t/x_t. The LP sets fee f_t ∈ [0, f_max] each block.
- External price: S_t follows GBM with compound Poisson jumps.
- Noise flow: Poisson arrivals with fee-elastic intensity λ(f_t) = λ_0 exp(−ε f_t); sizes are stochastic.
- Arbitrageur: Observes S_{t−L} with latency L and pays gas cost c_g (in quote units) per trade. Enters when expected profit is positive.

Stage t:
1) LP sets fee f_t based on public history. 2) S_t and noise trades realize. 3) Arbitrage decision using S_{t−L}. 4) Payoffs realized.

### 2.2. Payoffs and Adverse Selection Cost
- LP payoff per block: Fee revenue from all trades − Adverse Selection Cost (ASC). We define ASC as the ex-post mark-to-market loss from an arbitrage trade, evaluated at the contemporaneous external price: ASC_t = (Value of assets sent by LP) - (Value of assets received by LP) at price S_{t+1}. For an arbitrage trade resulting in reserve changes (Δx_t, Δy_t), this is ASC_t = max(0, Δy_t − S_{t+1} Δx_t) + max(0, S_{t+1} Δx_t - Δy_t). This metric isolates the loss on the specific trade causing adverse selection.
- Arbitrage payoff: a_t · max{Π_A,t(f_t; S_{t−L}) − c_g, 0} computed in quote units.

Decision vs evaluation: The arbitrageur uses S_{t−L} to decide and value their trade; ASC is computed ex-post at S_{t+1} to capture the LP’s loss at the contemporaneous market price. This separation reflects realistic latency for decision-making and contemporaneous valuation for accounting.

### 2.3. Repeated game and deterrence
The LP employs a trigger strategy: set fee f_L in a cooperative phase; upon detecting arbitrage, set fee f_H for T blocks (punishment); then revert to f_L.

**Deterrence against a myopic arbitrageur:**
A myopic arbitrageur enters if and only if the single-period profit exceeds gas costs. The trigger policy deters entry by ensuring that during the punishment phase, the expected profit is non-positive.
*Deterrence Condition (Myopic):* The punishment fee f_H must be set such that for typical price deviations, Π_A(f_H; S_{t-L}) − c_g ≤ 0. The low fee f_L is set to be profitable, i.e., Π_A(f_L; S_{t-L}) − c_g > 0 for the same deviation.

**Deterrence against a forward-looking arbitrageur (Heuristic):**
A forward-looking arbitrageur with discount factor δ weighs a one-time gain from deviating against the discounted stream of lost future profits during the T-period punishment. For deterrence to be effective, the one-shot gain from exploiting the AMM at fee f_L must be less than the expected cumulative profit they forego during the punishment phase. This requires the punishment to be credible—i.e., the LP must find it optimal to enforce the high-fee period despite losing some fee-elastic benign flow, because it is offset by the expected reduction in future ASC. A formal analysis would require modeling the stochastic arrival of arbitrage opportunities, which we leave for future work. Our simulation focuses on the robust myopic case.

Stochastic regime switching: Because arbitrage opportunities are driven by stochastic price movements (diffusion and jumps), even a deterred forward-looking agent may face extreme price dislocations where a one-shot deviation is profitable. This triggers the punishment phase, leading to endogenously switching fee regimes.

## 3. Simulation

### 3.1. Mechanics (fee-on-input CPAMM and arbitrage sizing)
We implement fee-on-input swaps. For input fee fraction γ = 1 − f ∈ (0,1), with current reserves (x, y) and k = x·y just before the trade:

- **y for x** (raise price; S_ext > p): After input dy, reserves become x' = k/(y + γ dy), y' = y + dy. Setting the post-trade pool price p' = y'/x' = S_ext yields a quadratic in dy with positive root:
  dy* = [ − y(1 + γ) + sqrt( y^2(1 + γ)^2 − 4γ(y^2 − S_ext·k) ) ] / (2γ).
- **x for y** (lower price; S_ext < p): After input dx, reserves become x' = x + dx, y' = k/(x + γ dx). Setting p' = y'/x' = S_ext yields:
  dx* = [ − x(1 + γ) + sqrt( x^2(1 + γ)^2 − 4γ( x^2 − k/S_ext ) ) ] / (2γ).

These closed forms set the post-trade pool price equal to S_ext under a fee-on-input model.

### 3.2. Environment and policies
- External price: GBM with jumps
  d ln S_t = (μ − 0.5σ^2) dt + σ dW_t + J_t, where J_t sums Poisson(λ_J dt) jumps with log-normal sizes LN(μ_J, σ_J^2).
- Noise flow: Poisson(λ_0 e^{−ε f_t} dt) arrivals with exponential size in quote units; buy/sell direction 50/50.
- Arbitrageur: Myopic; uses S_{t−L} to size and evaluate; pays gas c_g (quote).
- Policies:
  1) **Fixed fee**: f̄.
  2) **Trigger**: (f_L, f_H, T) with punishment on detected entry.

### 3.3. Reference Python implementation (minimal, reproducible)
Note: LP wealth is valued at S_{t+1}. Arbitrage decisions use S_{t−L}; ASC is computed ex-post at S_{t+1}. The invariant k = x·y is re-calculated before each trade.

### 3.4. Metrics and tests
- LP performance: Per-block PnL, annualized Sharpe ratio based on PnL standard deviation at block frequency, drawdowns.
- Market quality: Benign-flow share, AMM price volatility.
- Fee dynamics: ACF and Ljung–Box Q-test on fee time series to reject white-noise null under the trigger policy; regime-switching signatures (e.g., bimodal fee histograms).

**Falsification:**
- H1 (Regime switching): Reject if the fee series under the trigger policy fails to exhibit significant autocorrelation (e.g., Ljung–Box test fails to reject white noise).
- H2 (LP returns): Reject if optimized trigger policies do not improve Sharpe ratios relative to the best fixed fee across a majority of parameter grids; report bootstrap confidence intervals.

### 3.5. Sensitivity
Vary key parameters over grids: fee elasticity ε ∈ [10, 30], volatility σ ∈ [0.4, 0.8], latency L ∈ [1, 5], gas cost c_g, and jump parameters (λ_J, μ_J, σ_J). Use ≥50 seeds per grid point; report median, IQR, and 95% CIs. Provide ablation on punishment length T and severity f_H.

## 4. Discussion
Endogenous fees act as a simple, public commitment device that trades off attracting fee-elastic benign flow against deterring adverse selection. Trigger policies are implementable and effective against myopic arbitrageurs. For forward-looking arbitrageurs, deterrence relies on the credibility of punishment. Stochastic price dynamics ensure that fees switch between regimes rather than settling into a fixed state. Protocols can implement transparent, rule-based controllers keyed to observable proxies (e.g., large price realignments) to improve LP outcomes.

## 5. Limitations
We model a representative LP and arbitrageur, abstracting from ordering auctions, multi-pool routing, and inventory effects. Latency and gas are exogenous. A full dynamic programming solution for the forward-looking arbitrageur is not simulated. Governance constraints may limit rapid fee changes in practice. Calibration to on-chain data is required for quantitative policy design.

## 6. Conclusion
Dynamic, state-contingent fees can deter MEV and improve LP risk-adjusted returns. Our corrected AMM mechanics and simulations demonstrate endogenous regime switching and robust LP performance gains relative to fixed fees. We provide falsifiable predictions and open-source code to support empirical evaluation and adoption.
