1) Score: 10/10 — Highly novel synthesis of machine learning and IO, with a sharp, testable prediction of a phase transition.
2) Score: 10/10 — Creates a novel, testable centrality metric by powerfully fusing network theory with firm-level financial frictions.
3) Score: 9/10 — Provides a clear, falsifiable mechanism for the failure of a core economic theorem via bounded rationality.
4) Score: 9/10 — Connects information theory to labor matching with a sharp, testable prediction of market collapse at a noise threshold.
5) Score: 10/10 — Generates novel, non-obvious cyclical predictions for a policy-relevant market by applying dynamic signaling games.
6) Score: 9/10 — Offers a novel equilibrium concept for congestion games, predicting oscillations as a feature, not a bug.
7) Score: 10/10 — Applies classic entry-deterrence theory to the DeFi frontier, yielding timely and highly falsifiable predictions.
8) Score: 9/10 — Elegantly unifies information design and industrial organization to explain strategic behavior in modern data markets.
9) Score: 8/10 — Provides a sharp, testable prediction of hysteresis by adding a modern dynamic-systems lens to classic IO theory.
10) Score: 9/10 — Delivers a clean, falsifiable sustainability threshold for P2P insurance by synthesizing networks and repeated games.
