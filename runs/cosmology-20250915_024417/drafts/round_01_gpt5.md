Title: MEV-Deterrence via Endogenous AMM Fees in a Repeated Game: Cyclical Fee Equilibria and Improved LP Returns

Abstract
We study a repeated game between an automated market maker (AMM) liquidity provider (LP) who sets the trading fee and latency-constrained arbitrageurs who exploit price gaps (MEV). We model noise-trader order flow as fee-elastic and arbitrage profit as gap-, fee-, latency-, and gas-dependent. We show that dynamic, state-contingent fee policies can deter arbitrage entry via trigger strategies that are subgame-perfect when LPs are sufficiently patient and noise flow is sufficiently fee-elastic. The equilibrium generically exhibits fee cycles: low fees attract benign flow but eventually enable profitable arbitrage, which triggers temporarily high fees (punishment), after which fees relax. Python simulations of a constant-product AMM with stochastic external prices and order flow confirm that (i) adaptive fees induce endogenous cycles and (ii) improve LP risk-adjusted returns relative to fixed fees across a wide range of latencies and gas costs. We provide falsifiable predictions, open-source simulation code, and comparative statics.

Introduction
Decentralized exchanges (DEXs) built on constant-function market makers (CFMMs) such as Uniswap v2 enable on-chain trading with a fixed ad valorem fee. This design exposes LPs to adverse selection from arbitrageurs who rebalance the AMM to external prices, extracting loss-versus-rebalancing (LVR). This adverse selection is a form of miner/maximal extractable value (MEV), where latency, gas costs, and mempool competition shape entry.

While prior work has quantified LVR under fixed fees, the strategic role of fees in deterring MEV entry has been underexplored. We synthesize entry-deterrence in repeated games with DeFi microstructure by endogenizing AMM fees as a strategic instrument. Our central idea: LPs can condition fees on observed arbitrage to raise the expected cost of entry. In equilibrium, optimal policies are cyclical: low-fee phases attract benign flow; occasional arbitrage events trigger temporary high fees that reduce arbitrage incentives; after punishment, fees revert.

Contributions:
- A repeated-game model of an LP (fee-setter) and arbitrageur (entry decision) with fee-elastic benign flow and latency- and gas-sensitive arbitrage.
- A deterrence condition characterizing when trigger-fee strategies sustain a no-entry path as a subgame-perfect equilibrium.
- Prediction and mechanism for cyclical fee equilibria in AMMs.
- A Python simulator validating cycles and LP Sharpe improvements vs fixed-fee baselines, with falsification criteria and robustness to latency/gas.

Method
Setup
- AMM: constant product x y = k with ad valorem fee f_t ∈ [0, f_max] set per block t. Mid-price p_t = y_t/x_t.
- External reference price S_t follows a stochastic process (GBM with jumps).
- Noise traders: Poisson arrivals with intensity λ(f_t) = λ_0 exp(-ε f_t), trade size Q ∼ F_Q, buy/sell with equal probability. This captures fee elasticity of benign flow.
- Arbitrageurs: observe S_t with latency L and pay gas cost c_g per trade. They enter when expected net profit is positive given latency risk and fees. They act as price-takers at the AMM, trading to restore p_t to S_t subject to fees and slippage.

Stage game at block t
- LP chooses fee f_t after observing public history h_t (including past arbitrage events).
- Nature draws noise trades; arbitrageur chooses a_t ∈ {0,1} (no-entry/entry). If a_t = 1 and profitable, the arbitrageur executes the optimal swap that maximizes expected profit net of fees and gas.

Payoffs
- LP one-period payoff: π_L,t(f_t, a_t) = FeeRevenue_t(f_t) − LVR_t(f_t, a_t).
- Arbitrageur one-period payoff: π_A,t(f_t, a_t) = a_t max{Π_A,t(f_t) − c_g, 0}.
- Fee revenue from noise flow scales as λ(f_t) E[Q] f_t p_t (to first order).
- Arbitrage gross profit Π_A,t(f_t) equals the area between AMM and external price curves required to realign p_t to S_t, net of taker fee. For a constant-product AMM rebalanced from p to S by trading Δx, Δy:
    Π_A,t ≈ |∫_p^S L(p) dp| − fee_paid, where L(p) is the instantaneous marginal liquidity, and fee_paid ≈ f_t times notional traded. Latency reduces effective |S_t − p_t|; we model it by replacing S_t with S_{t+L} in expectation.

Repeated game and strategies
- Infinite horizon with discount factor δ ∈ (0,1).
- Public trigger-fee strategies for LP:
    f_t = f_L if no arbitrage observed in last T blocks; otherwise f_t = f_H for the next T blocks.
- Arbitrageur best response: enter if E[Π_A(f_t) − c_g | L] > 0.

Deterrence condition
Let Π_L ≡ E[Π_A(f_L)] and Π_H ≡ E[Π_A(f_H)]. Suppose Π_H − c_g ≤ 0 (high fee makes arbitrage unprofitable) and Π_L − c_g > 0 (low fee allows profitable entry). Consider the arbitrageur deviating (entering) in a no-entry path at f_L, which triggers T blocks of f_H:

One-shot deviation gain: G ≡ Π_L − c_g.
Discounted punishment loss: D ≡ δ (1 − δ^T)/(1 − δ) max{Π_L − Π_H, 0}.

If G ≤ D, then no-entry at f_L is a best response; the LP’s trigger strategy and arbitrageur’s no-entry form a subgame-perfect equilibrium. Intuition: the present value of foregone future profits during high-fee punishment outweighs the current profit from entry.

LP credibility requires that after observing entry, imposing f_H for T is a best response given continuation play. This holds when the LP’s continuation value with deterrence exceeds its value from permanently keeping f_L after entry, i.e., when the gain from reducing future LVR dominates the temporary loss of benign flow due to higher fees. Fee elasticity ε and LP patience δ are key.

Why cycles?
Stochastic S_t and noise flow imply that occasional large price moves or low latent volatility periods endogenously switch the arbitrageur’s incentives across the threshold Π_A(f_L) ≷ c_g. As a result, even under deterrence strategies, arbitrage eruptions occur, triggering temporary fee hikes followed by relaxation—i.e., persistent cycles. With continuous adjustments (e.g., proportional control on recent LVR), the system generically exhibits limit cycles due to the concave trade-off between fee-induced flow and arbitrage deterrence.

Experiments (falsification plan)
We implement a Python simulator that instantiates the stage game within an AMM microstructure. We test three policies:
- Fixed fees: f_t = f̄ ∈ {5, 30, 100} bps.
- Trigger fees: f_L = 10 bps, f_H = 100 bps, punishment length T ∈ {10, 50, 200}.
- Continuous control: f_{t+1} = clip[f_t + η (LVR_window_t − τ)] with step size η and LVR target τ.

Environment
- External price: S_{t+1} = S_t exp((μ − 0.5σ^2)Δ + σ√Δ ξ_t + J_t), with jumps J_t ~ compound Poisson.
- Noise flow: Poisson arrivals with rate λ(f_t) = λ_0 exp(−ε f_t), sizes Q ∼ LogNormal(m, s).
- Arbitrageur: latency L blocks, gas c_g; computes optimal trade given current state and expected S_{t+L} with Gaussian latency error; refrains if expected profit ≤ c_g.
- AMM: constant-product with fee f_t; LP earns fee revenue and bears LVR. We mark-to-market LP wealth and compute loss-vs-rebalancing exactly by comparing to continuous rebalancing at S_t.

Metrics and tests
- LP performance: average PnL, volatility, Sharpe; fee revenue; LVR; drawdowns.
- Market quality: spread proxy (effective price impact), realized volatility of AMM price vs external, fraction of benign flow.
- Arbitrage activity: entry rate, profits, share of volume.
- Cycles: autocorrelation function of f_t; periodogram; test for significant spectral peak at low frequency vs white-noise null (Ljung–Box and Fisher’s g-test).
- Falsification criteria:
    1) No significant fee cycles under adaptive policies (fail to reject white-noise at 5%).
    2) No improvement in LP Sharpe vs best fixed fee across robust parameter ranges.
    3) Adaptive policies increase LVR or degrade market quality persistently.

Key comparative statics
- Latency L: Higher L reduces Π_A; deterrence requires smaller f_H or shorter T.
- Gas c_g: Higher c_g strengthens deterrence; threshold Π_A − c_g crosses zero more often, increasing no-entry phases.
- Fee elasticity ε: Higher ε makes punishment costlier to LP; requires shorter T or moderate f_H to remain credible.

Evaluation procedure
- For each policy, compute:
    - LP Sharpe: mean(diff(lp_value)) / std(diff(lp_value)).
    - LVR share: cumulative LVR / cumulative fee revenue.
    - Spectral density of fees_bps under adaptive policies; test for significant peaks.
- Sweep parameters:
    - latency_L ∈ {0, 1, 3, 6, 12}, gas_cost ∈ {0, 1, 5, 10}, ε ∈ {5, 10, 20, 40}.
    - volatility σ ∈ {0.4, 0.8, 1.2}, jump_std ∈ {0.0, 0.05, 0.1}.
    - trigger T ∈ {10, 50, 200}, f_L ∈ {5, 10, 30} bps, f_H ∈ {50, 100, 300} bps.
- Hypotheses:
    H1 (cycles): fees_bps under trigger or continuous control exhibits significant low-frequency power relative to white-noise null.
    H2 (returns): adaptive policies yield higher LP Sharpe than best fixed fee for a majority of parameter settings, with non-inferior market quality metrics.
- Falsification: If H1 or H2 fail across robustness sweeps (controlling false discovery), the theory is falsified.

Discussion
- Synthesis with entry-deterrence: The LP’s fee is a commitment device analogous to capacity or limit pricing. Trigger strategies are public, simple, and credible when LPs are patient and benign flow is fee-elastic. The arbitrageur’s dynamic calculus weighs immediate gains against a discounted stream of foregone profits under punishment.
- Economic trade-offs: Higher fees deter arbitrage but reduce benign flow; optimal deterrence mixes brief, sharp punishments with long low-fee phases. Stochastic volatility and latency risk make exact no-entry unattainable; thus cycles are the typical outcome.
- Relation to DeFi microstructure: Our results connect LVR to an endogenous control variable (fees) and predict observable patterns: clustered arbitrage, bursty fee increases, and subsequent decay. These are empirically testable on-chain where fee tiers and dynamic fee protocols exist.
- Design implications: Protocols can implement public, rule-based fee controllers that condition on observable arbitrage proxies (e.g., large price corrections or LVR spikes), improving LP returns without introducing per-trade or trader-specific discrimination.

Limitations
- Single LP and representative arbitrageur abstractions; real markets have many heterogeneous LPs and MEV searchers with auction dynamics (e.g., PBS/MEV-Boost).
- Simplified noise-flow elasticity and price process; richer microstructure and cross-venue feedbacks may alter thresholds.
- We ignore inventory management and active rebalancing by LPs; adding these may interact with fee control.
- Credible commitment: Some chains/protocols may limit per-block fee changes; governance delays affect deterrence.
- Empirical calibration: Full validation requires calibrating ε, latency distributions, gas regimes, and volatility to on-chain data.

Conclusion
We propose and analyze endogenous AMM fee policies as a strategic instrument to deter MEV via entry-deterrence in a repeated game. Trigger and continuous fee controls generate cyclical equilibria and, in simulations, improve LP risk-adjusted returns compared to fixed fees across realistic latency and gas environments. The theory yields clear falsification tests and design guidelines for dynamic-fee AMMs. Next steps are empirical calibration to on-chain data and exploring multi-LP competition and implementation via protocol-level controllers.
