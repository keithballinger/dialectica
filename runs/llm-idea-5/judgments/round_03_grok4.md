The revised draft presents a highly novel LLM decoding method (LCD) that is focused on inference stability, with strong potential impact on quality and agentic workflows. It differentiates clearly from prior work, proposes a rigorous validation plan using small open-source models and code, and is structured logically for publication in a leading AI journal like TACL or NeurIPS. The writing is concise, evidence-based, and meets all specified constraints without needing changes.
