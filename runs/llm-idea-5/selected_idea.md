Selected idea #5:

5) Lookahead-Consistency Token Filtering
Summary: Before committing a token, run cheap k-step micro-rollouts and favor tokens whose continuations agree semantically, reducing hallucinations.
For a smart layperson: If a next word leads down paths that disagree with each other, it’s risky; if short peeks ahead mostly agree, it’s safer. We only choose next words that look stable under quick peeks.
Falsification: For each step, shortlist top-p tokens, roll out k=3 short continuations with a 1–2B “draft” model, score agreement via NLI or string entailment, reweight logits accordingly; test on TruthfulQA, BioASQ-lite, and WikiSQL text-to-SQL for factuality/exact-match versus normal and speculative decoding.
Novelty: Introduces agreement-based micro-lookaheads as a token-level filter distinct from draft acceptance checks in speculative decoding.
