The revised draft addresses the prior concerns effectively: it provides a concrete, reproducible algorithm for estimating the observation noise variance R using exponential moving average residuals, and for Q using first differences, ensuring practicality and reproducibility. Notational inconsistencies appear resolved, and the overall manuscript is concise, novel, and aligned with the constraintsâ€”focusing on LLM inference with validation via code and small open-source models, making it suitable for a leading journal like NeurIPS or ICLR. No further revisions needed.
