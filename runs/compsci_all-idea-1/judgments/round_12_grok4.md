Brief justification: The revised draft effectively incorporates the suggested fixes, enhancing clarity, correctness, and practicality while maintaining high novelty in post-hoc denoising for quantized LLM inference. The method is sound, the falsification plan is rigorous and code-validatable with open models, and the overall structure meets leading journal standards in the subfield without needing further changes.
