The draft presents a novel, rigorously formulated, and practical method for mitigating quantization noise in LLM inference. The core idea is methodologically sound, leveraging a standard state-space model with a principled, closed-form calibration procedure (method-of-moments on first differences) that is both reproducible and directly addresses the problem's structure. The paper demonstrates strong scientific practice by including a falsification-oriented experimental plan, complete with model-misspecification diagnostics. Practical implementation concerns, such as computational overhead and memory bandwidth, are addressed via a top-M variant and clear complexity analysis. The inclusion of numerical safeguards, robust estimation techniques, and comprehensive ablations further strengthens the proposal, making it a complete and compelling contribution ready for publication in a top-tier venue.
