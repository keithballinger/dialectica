The draft effectively critiques an implied original manuscript with targeted, evidence-based suggestions that enhance clarity, precision, and scientific rigor without altering core contributions. The revised paper draft is highly novel, introducing online adaptive subspace projections for KV cache compression in LLM inference, with rigorous theoretical bounds, falsification-oriented experiments, and validation plans using code and small open-source models like GPT-2. It meets all constraints and is suitable for a leading journal such as NeurIPS or ICLR.
