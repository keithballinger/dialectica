The revised draft effectively incorporates the suggested minor revisions, resulting in a polished, novel contribution to LLM inference optimization. The method's online adaptive subspace projection, backed by theoretical error bounds and a rigorous experimental plan with preliminary validation on open-source models, meets the constraints for high novelty and publishability in a leading computer science journal like NeurIPS or ICLR. The inclusion of reproducible code elements supports validation. No further changes are needed.
