The revised draft successfully incorporates all requested changes. The RoPE anchoring mechanism is now causal for streaming inference, the correctness conditions for the blockwise softmax are precise, residual computation is correctly identified as cost-free, and calibration procedures are well-defined. The systems analysis clearly delineates compute- and bandwidth-bound regimes. The resulting paper presents a novel, theoretically sound, and empirically verifiable method for low-rank KV cache compression that is of publishable quality for a leading venue.
