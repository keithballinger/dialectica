Brief justification: The revised draft effectively incorporates the suggested minor revisions, resulting in a clear, novel contribution to LLM inference with strong theoretical grounding, reproducible experiments on small open-source models, and code release. It meets all constraints and is suitable for a leading CS journal like NeurIPS or ICML.
