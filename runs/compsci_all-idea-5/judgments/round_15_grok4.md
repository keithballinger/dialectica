Brief justification: The revised draft meets all constraintsâ€”it's in CS focused on LLM inference, presents a highly novel per-step entropy control method with strong theoretical grounding and empirical validation using code and small open-source models (Pythia-410M/1.4B). The implementation, evaluations, and reproducibility details are robust, with minor issues from the prior critique adequately addressed, making it suitable for publication in a leading journal like ICLR or NeurIPS.
