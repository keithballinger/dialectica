This draft presents a highly novel decoding algorithm for LLM inference, backed by rigorous theory, a practical implementation, and reproducible experiments on small open-source models. The contributions are clearly positioned against related work, and the overall structure, evidence, and validation align with standards for a leading journal in AI/ML subfields like NeurIPS or ICML. No significant flaws warrant revisions.
