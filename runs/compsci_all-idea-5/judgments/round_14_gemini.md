Brief critique:
The manuscript is exceptionally clear, technically sound, and presents a novel and practical contribution to LLM inference. The theoretical analysis of entropy as a function of temperature is correct and provides a solid foundation for the proposed method. The experimental evaluation is rigorous, employing appropriate baselines, fair comparisons, and strong reproducibility standards.

Crucially, all issues raised in the prior review have been thoroughly addressed:
1.  **Interaction with Truncation:** Section 2.5 now provides a precise and correct analysis of how Target-Entropy Decoding interacts with fixed masks (top-k) versus temperature-dependent masks (top-p), including the necessary coupled iterative procedure for the latter. This resolves the main technical concern.
2.  **Clarity and Definitions:** All requested clarifications have been incorporated. Key terms ("softmax-equivalents"), units ("nats"), and selection criteria ("best" method) are now explicitly defined.
3.  **Efficiency Reporting:** The abstract and results tables now clearly report latency overhead in both relative terms (percentage increase) and absolute units (ms/token), alongside throughput (tokens/sec).
4.  **Reproducibility:** The commitment to release full baseline grids in the appendix is noted and appropriate for the final version. The existing reproducibility section is exemplary.

The resulting paper is a significant contribution, and no further revisions are required.
