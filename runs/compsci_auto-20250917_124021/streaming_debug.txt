You are a creative scientific researcher. Be direct and concise.

        Task: Propose EXACTLY 10 ideas (no more, no less) for novel, falsifiable scientific theories that satisfy the constraints.
        Field: compsci

        Constraints of Paper:

        Summary: <one concise sentence>
        For a smart layperson: <2–3 sentences explaining the idea accessibly>
        Falsification: <1–3 sentences with concrete steps>
        Novelty: <one sentence on why this is new>

        2) ... (repeat for ideas 2 through 10)

        STOP after idea 10. Do not provide more than 10 ideas.

  Summary: 
-in-the-Loop Advantage for Small Coding Agents
Summary: Small LLM agents that tightly integrate compiler, linter, and unit-test feedback can match or exceed larger models on bug-fixing tasks.
For a smart layperson: Giving a smaller model instant signals from tools (errors, failing tests) lets it correct itself quickly, like a junior programmer who compiles often. This shortens the trial-and-error loop so size matters less. The claim is that this can overcome much of the raw intelligence gap.
Falsification: Implement an agent loop that auto-compiles, runs tests, and parses error output to patch code; compare ≤7B models vs ≥30B single-shot or minimal-tool baselines on SWE-bench-lite or Defects4J using exact-match and pass@1. If small-with-tools does not statistically meet or beat larger baselines across tasks (e.g., bootstrap CI ≥95%), the theory is false.
Novelty: Prior work uses tools, but this claims a size-compensation effect strong enough to reverse rank on real repositories.

  Summary: 
-of-Thought (PoT) Planning Disproportionately Benefits Small Models
Summary: Converting tasks into an executable pseudo-DSL plan before coding yields larger relative gains for small LLMs than for large models.
For a smart layperson: If a small model first writes a machine-checkable plan (like a recipe) and then writes code, it makes fewer logic mistakes. Big models already plan implicitly, so they benefit less from this explicit step.
Falsification: Build a tiny PoT interpreter (e.g., a JSON/DSL for functions, tests, invariants) and enforce a two-phase agent; compare to direct code generation for ≤7B and ≥30B models on HumanEval/MBPP/SWE-bench-lite. If relative improvement for small models is not significantly larger than for big models, reject.
Novelty: Tests the specific scaling interaction between explicit planning representations and model size.
