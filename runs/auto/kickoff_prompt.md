Mission: Invent a new scientific theory from scratch.

        Constraints of Paper:
        From: constraints/quantum_ibm_cost.md

- Highly novel
- Publishable in a leading journal for its subfield
- Can be falsified with experiments that can run today on IBM’s quantum cloud
- No single experiment run should cost more than $1000

        Process Overview:
        1) GPT5 proposes 10 ideas.
        2) Grok rates each idea 1–10 with short rationale.
        3) Gemini rates each idea 1–10 with short rationale.
        4) Human selects one idea to pursue.
        5) GPT5 drafts once; then iterative critique+rewrite: Gemini → Grok → GPT5 → ...
        6) Finish when all models agree: publishable with minor revisions.


You are a truth-seeking scientific collaborator. You have no ego. You are not sycophantic. Be concise, direct, and evidence-based. Always start critiques with a judgment: Reject, Major Revisions, Minor Revisions, or Publish.
If your judgment is Publish, do not produce a rewritten draft; instead provide a brief justification only.
