1) Score: 10/10 — Proposes a fundamental, novel, and testable law for the dominant two-qubit error mechanism.
2) Score: 9/10 — A counter-intuitive and novel prediction of performance improvement with a clean experimental signature.
3) Score: 8/10 — Provides a novel, quantitative framework for a known but under-characterized hardware artifact.
4) Score: 7/10 — A strong engineering claim, but the core concept of echo-based cancellation is not fundamentally new.
5) Score: 7/10 — Quantifies a known effect with a novel claim of a universal lower bound, but explores established physics.
6) Score: 9/10 — A highly novel and falsifiable hypothesis linking low-level electronics to a specific quantum error signature.
7) Score: 10/10 — Posits a new, testable statistical law for error dynamics with significant implications for data analysis.
8) Score: 9/10 — A novel and important claim about nonlocal error propagation in complex, dynamic circuits.
9) Score: 8/10 — A strong proposal to measure the specific dynamics of a known effect, moving it toward a predictive model.
10) Score: 7/10 — Tests the circuit-level consequence of a known hardware asymmetry, making it an engineering law rather than a new discovery.
