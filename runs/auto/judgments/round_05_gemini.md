Brief critique
The manuscript has successfully addressed all points from the previous review. The experimental protocols and analysis are now robust, particularly with the correction to the state preparation in Protocol A and the introduction of the labeled correlator method to handle sign ambiguity. The theoretical motivation is more precise, terminology is consistent, and the cost analysis is appropriately cautious. The inclusion of a 1-qubit control experiment and discussion of practical considerations like leakage and imperfect single-qubit gates significantly strengthen the proposal. The hypothesis is clear, important, and now paired with a well-defined and verifiably low-cost set of falsification experiments. The paper is ready for publication.
