This revised draft meets all specified constraints: it proposes a highly novel hypothesis on parity bias in CR CNOT noise, is suitable for publication in a leading quantum information journal (e.g., PRX Quantum), outlines falsifiable experiments runnable on current IBM quantum cloud hardware, and ensures per-job costs remain well under $1000 via shot counts and pricing estimates with verification notes. The structure is clear, evidence-based, and incorporates prior critiques effectively, with no major flaws requiring revision.
