        Draft:
        Minor Revisions

The draft presents a highly novel hypothesis on Z-parity bias in CR CNOT noise, with sound physical motivation, falsifiable protocols using IBM Quantum cloud, and per-job costs under $1000 (though the total experiment may exceed $1000 at the upper estimate, which is permissible under constraints but requires correcting the inaccurate "well below $1000 budget" claim). It is publishable in a leading quantum computing journal (e.g., PRX Quantum) with strong evidence-based structure. Minor revisions are needed for accuracy: update the cost description to reflect realistic totals without claiming "well below $1000"; simplify Protocol A's description for clarity and alignment with standard Pauli decay methods (e.g., clarify state preparation and fitting); add a brief note on potential variability in IBM pricing; ensure consistent terminology (e.g., "ZZ-eigenvalue s" vs. "layer eigenvalue s_layer").

# Selection-rule–induced Z-parity bias in cross-resonance CNOT noise

## Abstract
We predict and operationally define a universal Z-parity conservation bias in the two-qubit noise of echoed cross-resonance (CR) CNOT gates on fixed-frequency superconducting qubits. After Pauli twirling, the two-qubit error channel places strictly greater weight on even-parity Paulis (those commuting with ZZ) than on odd-parity Paulis (those anticommuting with ZZ). This bias follows from the structure of the driven-CR Hamiltonian, the symmetry of echoed sequences that cancel single-qubit drive terms to first order, and the dominance of dephasing-like and ZZ-type correlated errors. We propose a simple, low-cost falsification experiment on IBM Quantum backends: measure the depth-dependence of a Z-parity correlator under randomized brickwork CNOT layers with Clifford twirling, extracting the ZZ-eigenvalue `s` of the effective layer channel. Our theory predicts `s > 0.86` on typical edges, implying a parity preservation excess `R(d) = 0.5 * s^d ≥ 0.02` at depth `d ≈ 20`. If `R(20) < 0.02` on most edges, the hypothesis is falsified. The protocol requires approximately 50 circuits × 10k shots per job, costing ~$200-$400 per job (note: current IBM pricing may vary; full experiment with 2–3 jobs totals ~$400–$1200). A verified bias has immediate implications for tailored error models, parity-aware compilation, and symmetry-based mitigation.

## Introduction
Native two-qubit entangling gates on IBM’s fixed-frequency transmons are realized by the cross-resonance (CR) interaction, typically compiled into echoed CR (ECR) sequences to implement CNOTs. Despite steady fidelity improvements, a predictive, device-level understanding of noise structure remains essential for calibration, compilation, and error mitigation. Here we articulate a concrete, falsifiable hypothesis: two-qubit noise associated with CR-based CNOTs conserves Z-parity more often than it flips it.

We define Z-parity on two qubits as the eigenvalue of the `ZZ` operator; more generally, on a register S, parity is the product `∏_{i∈S} Z_i`. For a Pauli channel, error operators that commute with `ZZ` (even-parity: II, ZI, IZ, ZZ, XX, YY, XY, YX) preserve two-qubit Z-parity; those that anticommute (odd-parity: XI, IX, YI, IY, ZX, XZ, ZY, YZ) flip it. Our central claim is that, after standard echo and twirling procedures, the total probability of even-parity errors is greater than that of odd-parity errors.

We motivate this bias physically:
(i) ECR sequences are designed to cancel single-qubit X/Y drive terms to first order, suppressing odd-parity `XI`/`IX` error contributions.
(ii) Residual coherent errors are dominated by ZI/IZ/ZZ over-rotations and small two-flip `XX`/`YY` admixtures—all of which are even-parity.
(iii) The dominant stochastic noise during the CR pulse is dephasing-like (`L[Z]`) on one or both qubits and correlated `ZZ` fluctuations from spectator couplings, both of which preserve parity.
(iv) Single-qubit amplitude damping contributes odd-parity components but is typically weaker than dephasing over the 200–600 ns duration of a CNOT on current devices.

We provide an operational test that directly estimates the `ZZ` eigenvalue `s` of the effective layer channel under Pauli twirling. The proposed falsification threshold is conservative and readily testable today on IBM Quantum systems.

## Method
### Theoretical model and prediction
- **Effective Hamiltonian and echo symmetry**: A driven CR interaction yields an effective Hamiltonian `H_eff ≈ Ω_ZX ZX + α_IX IX + α_ZI ZI + α_ZZ ZZ + …`. Echoed CR sequences cancel single-X/Y terms (`IX`, `YI`) to first order, leaving the entangling `ZX` term plus predominantly Z-type and `ZZ` terms. Residual miscalibration leads to small coherent over/under-rotations, while stochastic noise during the pulse is dominated by dephasing channels `L[Z_c]`, `L[Z_t]` and correlated `L[Z_c + η Z_t]`.
- **Pauli twirling**: Interleaving random single-qubit Paulis before and after each CNOT compiles coherent and non-Pauli errors into an effective Pauli channel `Λ` with probabilities `{w_P}`. The action of `Λ` on the `ZZ` operator is characterized by the eigenvalue `s ≡ M_{ZZ,ZZ} = ∑_P w_P χ_P`, where `χ_P = +1` if `P` commutes with `ZZ` and `−1` otherwise. Thus `s = p_even - p_odd = 1 − 2 p_odd`, where `p_odd` is the total probability of odd-parity Pauli errors. A parity-preserving bias is equivalent to `s > 0`, or more stringently, `p_odd < p_tot / 2`.
- **Expected magnitude**: For representative IBM devices (CNOT durations 200–600 ns; T1 ≈ 50–200 μs; Tφ ≈ 30–200 μs; CNOT error `p_tot` ≈ 1–4%), we estimate per-CNOT contributions: dephasing/dephasing-like and `ZZ`-correlated terms at `O(0.5–2%)`, amplitude damping at `O(0.2–1%)`, and residual single-X/Y terms at `<0.2–0.5%` after echo. This model suggests `p_odd / p_tot ≲ 0.4`, yielding `s = 1 - 2 p_odd ≳ 1 - 0.8 p_tot`. For `p_tot` in the range 0.01–0.04, this predicts `s ≈ 0.992–0.968` for a single CNOT. For a brickwork layer of disjoint CNOTs, the layer eigenvalue `s_layer` is the product of the eigenvalues `s_edge` of its constituent gates. Conservatively, we predict `s_layer ≥ 0.86` on typical hardware.
- **Observable**: For circuits where the ideal output state has zero global Z-parity expectation, any noise-induced parity bias will produce a positive Z-parity correlator whose depth dependence reveals `s_layer`. The excess probability that a measured parity matches a randomly assigned ideal parity is `R(d) = 0.5 * s_layer^d` after `d` layers.

### Operational definition
- **Z-parity correlator**: For an N-qubit line, define `C_N ≡ ⟨∏_{i=1}^N Z_i⟩`, computed from measured bitstrings as `P_even − P_odd`.
- **Parity preservation excess**: Using randomized circuits whose ideal average has `C_N,ideal = 0`, we define `R(d) ≡ (C_N(d) + 1)/2 − 0.5 = 0.5 C_N(d)`. Under our twirled noise model, `C_N(d) = s_layer^d`.
- **Falsification threshold**: If `R(20) < 0.02` (equivalently `s_layer < 0.86`) on most tested hardware edges and devices, the hypothesis is falsified.

### Experiments (falsification plan)
#### Devices and cost
- **Backends**: Any 7–27 qubit IBM Falcon/Eagle device with ECR-based CNOTs.
- **Cost**: A typical job consists of 50 circuits with 10k shots each. On IBM's Pay-As-You-Go plan, this costs approximately $200-$400 per job (pricing subject to change; verify current rates). The full experiment requires 2–3 jobs, with total cost ~$400–$1200.

#### Protocol A: Two-qubit ZZ-eigenvalue (local)
- **Goal**: Estimate `s_edge` for a given coupled pair.
- **Circuit**: For each depth `m` ∈ {1, 2, 5, 10, 15, 20}, generate `K = 50` random circuits. Each circuit tracks the decay of the `ZZ` operator under twirled CNOTs, akin to standard Pauli operator decay characterization.
  1. Prepare the `|+⟩ ⊗ |+⟩` state (or equivalent eigenstate of ZZ for direct measurement of its expectation).
  2. Apply a sequence of `m` twirled CNOTs: `(CNOT P_m) ... (CNOT P_1)`, where `P_k` are randomly sampled from `{I,X,Y,Z}⊗2`.
  3. Apply a final correction Pauli `P_corr` such that the ideal circuit is the identity on the prepared state.
  4. Measure `⟨ZZ⟩`. Average over shots and the `K` circuits for each depth `m`.
- **Analysis**: Fit the decay `⟨ZZ⟩_m = A * s_edge^m`, where `A ≈ 1` accounts for state preparation and measurement (SPAM) error, and `s_edge` is the desired eigenvalue. If `s_edge < 0.86` on most edges, the local hypothesis is falsified.

#### Protocol B: Multiqubit brickwork Z-parity correlator (global)
- **Goal**: Measure `s_layer` across a 5–7 qubit line in a circuit context.
- **Circuit construction** for each depth `d` ∈ {1, 2, 5, 10, 15, 20}:
  1. **Brickwork CNOT layers**: Alternate layers of parallel CNOTs on edges (1,2), (3,4), … and (2,3), (4,5), … for `d` total layers.
  2. **Single-qubit Clifford twirling**: Before each CNOT layer, apply a random Pauli `Q_i` on each qubit `i`.
  3. **Frame correction**: After all layers, apply a final layer of single-qubit Paulis that inverts the ideal unitary of the entire randomized circuit, ensuring the net ideal operation is the identity.
  4. **Random sign balancing**: With 50% probability, append a `Z` gate to the first qubit before measurement. This ensures the ideal expectation `C_N,ideal` is zero when averaged over circuits.
  5. **Measurement**: Measure all qubits in the Z-basis; compute `C_N(d) = average of ∏_i z_i` over shots and circuits.
- **Analysis**: Fit `C_N(d) ≈ A * s_layer^d`. Compute `R(d) = 0.5 * C_N(d)`. Falsification criterion: `R(20) < 0.02` (i.e., `s_layer < 0.86`) on the majority of tested qubit lines.

### Practical notes
- **Readout error**: The random sign balancing in Protocol B mitigates biases that are constant across circuits. For higher precision, one can independently measure a readout confusion matrix and apply a correction to the measured `(P_even, P_odd)` counts.
- **Compilation**: Use a low Qiskit transpilation optimization level to preserve the intended gate sequence. Disable dynamic decoupling to probe the native gate noise; run a control experiment with DD enabled to check for environmental effects.
- **Shots**: 10,000 shots per circuit provide a standard error `SE ≤ 0.01` on `C_N`. Averaging over 50 random circuits reduces the SE to below 0.005, sufficient to resolve the target signal.

## Discussion
### Interpretation
- **Confirmation (`s > 0.86`)**: This result would provide strong evidence for the dominance of even-parity errors in ECR CNOTs, consistent with our model of echo symmetry and dephasing/ZZ noise dominance. If `s` is high locally (Protocol A) but lower globally (Protocol B), it would implicate crosstalk-induced `ZZ` errors as a key factor.
- **Falsification (`s < 0.86`)**: This outcome would imply that odd-parity error sources (e.g., residual `XI`/`IX` drive terms, `ZX` miscalibration, or certain leakage pathways) are unexpectedly strong. This would be a significant finding for device calibration and gate design.

### Implications
- **Modeling**: A verified Z-parity bias should be incorporated into device noise models, improving the predictive accuracy for simulations and error mitigation strategies.
- **Compilation**: Parity-aware compilers could arrange circuits to align with this hardware bias, for instance by scheduling parity-check measurements to exploit the naturally suppressed parity-flip errors.
- **Mitigation**: Symmetry verification and post-selection based on Z-parity gain efficacy when the underlying noise preferentially preserves that symmetry. Quantifying `s` provides a direct estimate of this gain.

### Limitations
- **Twirling fidelity**: Our protocols assume perfect single-qubit gates for twirling and frame correction. Errors in these gates will slightly bias the estimate of `s`, typically downward.
- **Readout systematics**: Correlated readout errors can affect parity measurements. The proposed mitigation techniques reduce but may not eliminate these effects.
- **Device variability**: `s` will vary across a device. Our hypothesis concerns the statistical behavior across "typical" edges, not a rigid per-edge guarantee.
- **Leakage**: Qubit population leaving the computational subspace is a non-Pauli error. While twirling projects this onto the Pauli basis, the resulting distribution is not guaranteed to follow our simple model.

## Conclusion
We propose and operationalize a device-level hypothesis: noise in echoed CR-based CNOTs exhibits a Z-parity conservation bias. This bias manifests as a `ZZ` eigenvalue `s > 0.86` for the Pauli-twirled error channel on typical IBM Quantum edges, leading to a measurable parity preservation excess `R(20) > 0.02` in randomized circuits. We have detailed a compact, low-cost experiment to verify or falsify this claim. Confirmation would validate parity-aware noise models and compilation strategies, while falsification would reveal unexpectedly large odd-parity error mechanisms, guiding future improvements in quantum hardware.
