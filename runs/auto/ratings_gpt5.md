1) Score: 8/10 — High novelty with a clear parity-correlator test at low cost on few-qubit lines; predictions are specific and readily falsifiable within IBM backends.
2) Score: 7/10 — Concept is moderately novel versus known DD/echo effects, but yields a sharp, testable non-monotonic signature with simple delay sweeps well under budget.
3) Score: 6/10 — Correlated readout errors from multiplexing are somewhat known, but a covariance-threshold test is easy, cheap, and sharply falsifiable.
4) Score: 7/10 — Palindromic echoing is known, yet the claimed >30% advantage over RC is a bold, falsifiable inequality test doable within <$100.
5) Score: 6/10 — Spectator-induced CR degradation is recognized qualitatively; proposing an edge-agnostic ≥20% effect is novel enough and cheaply testable via interleaved RB.
6) Score: 5/10 — Linking beat notes in SX sequences to DAC quantization is novel but the effect size may be below noise, though the experiment is cheap and falsifiable.
7) Score: 8/10 — Time-clustered leakage manifesting as HOG overdispersion is novel and gives a crisp Fano>1.5 criterion that current hardware can test within budget.
8) Score: 7/10 — Nonlocal mid-circuit backaction is underexplored; a ≥5% T2* shift via Ramsey with toggled measure/reset is specific, falsifiable, and inexpensive.
9) Score: 7/10 — A duty-cycle–dependent T1 dip with ms recovery is plausible and novel in public data, with a straightforward heater–probe protocol under cost limits.
10) Score: 7/10 — Directionality asymmetry is known, but a global orientation law with >10% HOG gap is a new, easily falsifiable compilation-level claim feasible on IBM.
