1) Score: 9/10 — This is a highly novel, causal hypothesis about in-context learning that is directly falsifiable through controlled training experiments.
2) Score: 9/10 — This presents a sharp, testable architectural hypothesis about algorithmic capacity that is highly feasible to investigate with synthetic tasks.
3) Score: 8/10 — This proposes a novel and fundamental trade-off law, but its high computational cost for verification slightly reduces its feasibility score.
4) Score: 8/10 — A timely and novel hypothesis about a negative externality of RAG, testable with a straightforward and feasible controlled experiment.
5) Score: 9/10 — This is a deeply novel idea linking discrete training dynamics to OOD generalization with a clear, albeit technically challenging, falsification path.
6) Score: 7/10 — This makes a strong, specific claim about length extrapolation that is highly feasible to test, though it builds on existing work on RoPE scaling.
7) Score: 8/10 — A novel principle connecting gradient geometry to feature interpretability that is clearly falsifiable, though implementing the regularizer may be difficult.
8) Score: 10/10 — A surprising, highly novel, and eminently falsifiable claim identifying a simple internal correlate for a complex emergent ability.
9) Score: 7/10 — This formalizes a widely used intuition into a testable hypothesis about uncertainty, providing a solid and feasible empirical contribution.
10) Score: 9/10 — This is a novel, deep theoretical claim linking unimodal representation geometry to cross-modal alignment with a clear, if expensive, falsification protocol.
