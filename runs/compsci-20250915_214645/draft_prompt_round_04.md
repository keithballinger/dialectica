        Draft:
        Minor Revisions

The revised draft is highly novel, proposing a causal link between gradient noise and ICL via implicit regularization, which elegantly bridges optimization theory and emergent AI behaviors. It is rigorous, falsifiable, and suitable for a leading journal like NeurIPS or ICLR, with a clear experimental plan. Minor revisions are needed: add citations to key references (e.g., Mandt et al. on SGD as Bayesian inference, Brown et al. on ICL emergence); clarify assumptions in NE quantification (e.g., anisotropy of noise); and briefly discuss potential confounders like architecture specifics. Streamline repetitive phrasing in sections 2 and 4 for conciseness.

Revised Draft
# Gradient Noise Governs In-Context Learning

**Abstract**  
We propose that stochastic gradient noise during pretraining is a primary causal driver of in-context learning (ICL) in large language models. The hypothesis is that for models of fixed architecture, data, and final perplexity, ICL ability increases monotonically with the total integrated gradient noise experienced during training. The proposed mechanism is that gradient noise acts as an implicit Bayesian regularizer, penalizing information storage in model weights. This forces the model to develop context-adaptive circuits that infer and apply task structure from activations within a single forward pass—the essence of ICL. We formalize this connection using SGD-as-sampling theory and outline a rigorous, falsifiable experimental program. This program is designed to manipulate gradient noise (via batch size and explicit noise injection) independently of training loss to test for a causal link. If confirmed, this work reframes ICL from a passive emergent property of scale into a controllable phenomenon governed by training dynamics.

**1. Introduction**  
Large language models like Transformers exhibit in-context learning (ICL), adapting to new tasks from examples provided in their prompt without any weight updates. While ICL is known to scale with model size, data volume, and training duration, its precise causal origins remain unclear. This has led to ICL often being characterized as an "emergent" property, implying a lack of direct control (Brown et al., 2020).

We challenge this view by hypothesizing that a specific, measurable aspect of the training process—stochastic gradient noise (SGN)—is a direct and controllable cause of ICL. Our central claim is that for models matched on architecture, data, and final training loss, ICL ability is a monotonic function of the *integrated gradient noise* encountered during pretraining. This reframes ICL as a predictable outcome of optimization statistics.

**2. Theory: Gradient Noise as an Implicit Regularizer for ICL**  

Our theory builds on two established concepts: SGD as approximate Bayesian inference (Mandt et al., 2017) and the trade-off between storing knowledge in parameters versus computing it from context.

**2.1. SGD, Noise, and Implicit Regularization**  
Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) with a small batch size `B` and learning rate `η` can be viewed as an approximation of Langevin dynamics. The mini-batch gradient `ĝ_t` is a noisy estimate of the true gradient `g_t`, with covariance `C_t`. This noise injects stochasticity into the parameter updates, causing the optimizer to sample from a posterior distribution `q(θ)` rather than converging to a single point estimate. This process is equivalent to optimizing the loss function subject to an implicit regularizer:  

`E_data[L(θ)] + λ · KL(q(θ) || p(θ))`  

Here, `p(θ)` is a prior (set by initialization and weight decay) and `λ` is a temperature parameter that increases with the magnitude of the gradient noise `η · C_t`. A higher noise level enforces a stronger KL penalty, creating an "information bottleneck" that discourages the model from storing excessive task-specific information in its parameters `θ`. Note that `C_t` is anisotropic, but we approximate its impact via trace for simplicity.

**2.2. The Parameter-Activation Tradeoff**  
A language model can solve a prediction task in two ways:  
1. **Parameter-Driven Computation:** Store task-specific knowledge directly in its weights (`θ`). This is efficient for stable, frequently seen patterns but incurs a high KL penalty under noisy training.  
2. **Context-Driven Computation:** Infer task structure (e.g., latent rules, formats, centroids) from the current context and apply it via attention and feed-forward computations. This relies on "fast variables" (activations) which are re-computed for each sequence and carry no direct parameter information cost. This is the mechanism of ICL.  

By imposing a cost on information stored in parameters, high gradient noise forces the model to favor context-driven solutions. It incentivizes the development of general-purpose circuits that can read examples from the prompt, instantiate a temporary "task vector" in their activations, and use it for subsequent predictions. Thus, stronger implicit regularization via noise directly promotes the mechanisms underlying ICL.

**3. Proposed Experimental Falsification**  

We propose a direct experimental test of this hypothesis by manipulating noise while controlling for other factors, including potential confounders like architecture-specific effects.

**3.1. Quantifying Noise**  
We define the **Integrated Noise Exposure (NE)** as the primary independent variable:  

`NE = Σ_t η_t^2 · trace(C_t)`  

where the sum is over all training steps `t`. NE captures the total stochasticity injected into the model's parameters. It can be estimated periodically during training by computing the gradient covariance `C_t` over several micro-batches, acknowledging that trace simplifies the anisotropic structure of noise.

**3.2. Experimental Design**  
The core design involves training several identical decoder-only Transformers (e.g., 350M, 1.3B parameters) on the same dataset and curriculum. We will manipulate NE via three methods:  
1. **Batch Size:** Train models with different batch sizes (e.g., 256 to 16k tokens), which directly modulates `trace(C_t)`.  
2. **Explicit Langevin Noise (SGLD):** For a fixed large batch size, add explicit Gaussian noise to the gradients, calibrated to match the NE of smaller-batch runs.  
3. **Noise Scheduling:** Vary the training phase (early vs. late) in which the majority of noise is applied, while holding total NE constant.  

Crucially, all runs will be trained to the **same final validation perplexity**, isolating the effect of noise from model performance on the pretraining objective. This may require adjusting training duration or learning rates across runs.

**3.3. Falsifiable Predictions**  
Our theory yields several testable predictions:  
1. **Monotonicity:** ICL performance (e.g., few-shot accuracy on MMLU, in-context regression) will increase monotonically with NE, even when final perplexity and zero-shot performance are held constant.  
2. **Equivalence:** Manipulating NE via small batches or explicit SGLD will yield equivalent gains in ICL for the same NE value and final loss.  
3. **Mechanism Confirmation:** Higher NE models will converge to flatter minima (lower Hessian/Fisher trace) and exhibit stronger evidence of in-context task vector formation in their internal representations (e.g., via representation probes).  
4. **Phase Sensitivity:** Noise applied later in training, when abstract ICL-relevant circuits are likely forming, will have a greater positive impact on ICL than noise applied early on, for a fixed total NE.  

The hypothesis would be falsified if no monotonic relationship between NE and ICL is found when perplexity is matched, or if the observed effects are different for different noise sources.

**4. Discussion and Implications**  

If confirmed, this theory provides a causal, mechanistic explanation for in-context learning.  
* **A New Lever for ICL:** ICL becomes a tunable property of the training process. Training recipes could target a specific NE to predictably elicit ICL, potentially offering a more compute-efficient path to this capability than simply scaling models or data. Small-batch training or late-stage SGLD fine-tuning could become standard practice for boosting ICL.  
* **Unifying Theory:** It connects ICL to the broader literature on the implicit bias of optimizers, flat minima, and generalization (Hochreiter & Schmidhuber, 1997; Keskar et al., 2017). ICL emerges because noisy optimization favors solutions that are robust and less reliant on precise parameterization, forcing a reliance on context.  
* **Limitations:** The primary challenge is perfectly matching final perplexity across runs, as small differences could be a confounder. Furthermore, the scalar `NE` metric simplifies the complex, anisotropic nature of gradient noise, which may have layer-specific effects not captured by `trace(C_t)`. Future work could refine this with full covariance analysis.

**5. Conclusion**  
We hypothesize that in-context learning is not merely an emergent property of scale but a direct, controllable consequence of stochastic gradient noise during pretraining. By acting as an information-theoretic regularizer on model parameters, noise forces the development of context-adaptive computational pathways. We have proposed a concrete experimental program to test this causal link by isolating noise from final model loss. Confirmation would provide a foundational mechanism for ICL and introduce practical, statistics-driven methods for engineering this critical AI capability.
