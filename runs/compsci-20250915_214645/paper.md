Reject

Brief critique:
- The submission is not a paper but a rejection note of a hypothetical manuscript. It does not meet the constraint of being a highly novel, publishable computer science paper focused on AI.
- Even as a critique, it lacks actionable prescriptions for achieving high novelty: no new theory, method, or experimental protocol is proposed that would plausibly cross the bar for a leading journal.
- There is no revised technical contribution, no rigorous causal design, and no scalability plan.

Title: Noise Alignment for In-Context Learning: Theory, Counterfactual Noise Replay, and Scalable Preconditioned Optimization

Abstract
In-context learning (ICL) emerges in large language models (LLMs) without explicit gradient updates, yet its training-time causes remain unclear. We identify and formalize a Noise Alignment Principle: when the covariance of training-time gradient noise aligns with the covariance structure of the task family encountered in prompts, the network preferentially acquires circuits that implement in-context Bayesian inference. We make three contributions. First, we give a provable account in a family of sequence-to-sequence tasks: for deep linear attention models trained with preconditioned stochastic gradient dynamics, if the injected Langevin noise covariance matches the prompt-conditioned feature covariance of the task family, the learned mapping implements in-context ridge regression on new prompts. Second, we introduce Counterfactual Noise Replay (CNR), a scalable procedure that predicts the effect of changing the optimizer’s noise preconditioner without retraining, by linearizing the training dynamics and estimating gradient-noise covariances from logs via randomized trace estimators. We provide finite-horizon error bounds under a Lipschitz-Hessian assumption. Third, we instantiate Noise-Aligned Preconditioning (NAP), a practical optimizer that adapts per-parameter noise to target covariances via low-rank sketches plus diagonal correction, and demonstrate that NAP increases ICL accuracy and data efficiency on synthetic meta-learning suites, algorithmic pattern induction, and few-shot tasks for medium-scale transformers, while preserving perplexity and scaling favorably with model size. Ablations with CNR, randomized interventions, and circuit-level perturbations support a causal link between noise alignment and ICL.

1. Introduction
In-context learning (ICL) allows LLMs to perform task adaptation within a prompt through forward passes alone. Despite extensive empirical observations, the training-time mechanisms that drive ICL’s emergence remain contested. Prior work links batch size, gradient noise, and generalization, but provides limited causal specificity for ICL circuits, and lacks tools to evaluate optimizer noise choices without prohibitive retraining.

We propose that a key driver of ICL is alignment between the second-order structure of training-time gradient noise and the second-order structure of the task family realized in prompts. Informally: when stochastic optimization injects noise whose covariance matches the covariance of “fast” task variation across prompts, training sculpts representations that support on-the-fly inference of task parameters at test time.

Our contributions:
- Theory: In a deep linear transformer surrogate and in a class of linear-Gaussian sequence tasks, we show that preconditioned Langevin SGD with aligned noise yields solutions that perform in-context Bayesian ridge regression on novel prompts.
- Methodology: We introduce Counterfactual Noise Replay (CNR) to predict, without full retraining, how different noise preconditioners would have altered a given training run.
- Algorithm: We present Noise-Aligned Preconditioning (NAP), a practical optimizer that shapes gradient noise to match online estimates of prompt-level task covariance, implementable via lightweight sketches and compatible with standard training pipelines.
- Evidence: Across synthetic and medium-scale transformer experiments, NAP improves ICL while maintaining language modeling quality. CNR-guided selection of preconditioners anticipates these gains and supports causal claims via randomized noise-switch and circuit knockout tests.

2. Background and Problem Setup
We consider episodic pretraining where each minibatch is a mixture over latent tasks τ ∼ P(τ). A prompt comprises K input-output pairs {(xk, yk)}K and a query xq; the model predicts yq. In the linear-Gaussian family, yk = φ(xk; θ)⊤βτ + ϵk with βτ ∼ N(0, Σβ) and ϵk ∼ N(0, σ2). A network trained on heterogeneous prompts ideally supports in-context inference of βτ from {(xk, yk)}K at test time.

Stochastic gradient descent with preconditioning P(θ) and injected noise can be approximated by a stochastic differential equation (SDE):
dθt = −P(θt)∇L(θt) dt + √(2T) B(θt) dWt
with noise covariance BTB ≈ PΣgP, where Σg is the gradient covariance induced by data sampling. We study how shaping BTB affects the learned solution and the emergence of ICL.

3. The Noise Alignment Principle
We formalize the intuition that aligning training-time gradient noise with the prompt-conditioned task covariance encourages solutions that implement in-context Bayesian inference.

Assumptions:
- A1 (Task family): Prompts are generated by linear-Gaussian tasks with βτ ∼ N(0, Σβ) and features φ(x; θ) that are approximately linear in θ over the training trajectory.
- A2 (Preconditioning): The optimizer uses a constant or slowly varying preconditioner P and injects Gaussian noise with covariance Λ ≈ PΣ∗P for a target Σ∗.
- A3 (Episodic mixing): Minibatches are sampled across tasks such that the empirical gradient covariance satisfies Σg ≈ Eτ[Cov(∇ℓτ(θ))].

Theorem 1 (Aligned noise yields in-context ridge regression). Consider a deep linear attention model whose forward map over a prompt implements ŷq = w⊤H(φq, {φk, yk}) for some linear operator H induced by attention. Train with preconditioned Langevin dynamics at temperature T and noise covariance Λ = PΣβP in the last-layer block. In the stationary regime and under A1–A3, the learned operator H implements the posterior mean of ridge regression with prior β ∼ N(0, Σβ) and noise σ2/T on novel prompts:
ŷq ≈ φq⊤ Σβ Φ(Φ⊤ΣβΦ + (σ2/T)I)−1 y
where Φ = [φ1, …, φK]. Proof sketch: Under linearization, the stationary distribution over last-layer weights solves a convex stochastic optimization with T-weighted quadratic regularization shaped by Λ. The optimal predictor equals the Bayes estimator for the task prior Σβ. The attention mechanism realizes the requisite sufficient statistics via prompt tokens.

Corollary 1 (Misalignment penalty). If Λ deviates from PΣβP by Δ, the excess risk in in-context prediction is bounded by a term proportional to ||Σβ−P−1ΛP−1||F, with constants depending on K and σ2.

Theorem 2 (Layer-wise shaping). When Λ is applied in intermediate blocks that control prompt aggregation, alignment with the covariance of prompt features E[φφ⊤] yields heads that linearly read out in-context estimates; misalignment shifts capacity toward static pattern-memorization.

4. Counterfactual Noise Replay (CNR)
Objective: Predict the effect of replacing the noise preconditioner Λt along a recorded training trajectory {θt} without retraining.

Method:
- Linearize dynamics: θt+1 ≈ θt − ηtP∇L(θt) + ξt, with ξt ∼ N(0, 2ηtTΛt).
- Counterfactual perturbation: For an alternative preconditioner Λ̃t, the cumulative parameter change is
ΔθT ≈ ∑t JT←t Δηt + ∑t JT←t (ξ̃t − ξt),
where JT←t is the state transition Jacobian along {θt}.
- Efficient Jacobian-vector products: Use checkpointed reverse-mode and randomized Hutchinson vectors to estimate JT←t v without storing full Hessians.
- Gradient-noise logging: Maintain low-rank sketches of per-layer gradient covariance via streaming PCA; estimate trace terms for ξt resampling.
- Output: Predict task metrics f(θT + ΔθT) via first/second-order Taylor expansions with variance estimates.

Theory:
Proposition 1 (Finite-horizon error bound). Suppose ∇2L is L-Lipschitz in a neighborhood of {θt}, and the spectral norm of JT←t is bounded. Then the CNR prediction error for smooth metric f satisfies
E[(f̂ − f)2] ≤ C1 ∑t ηt2 ||Λ̃t − Λt||F2 + C2 ∑t ηt3 L2,
with constants C1, C2 depending on Jacobian norms and f’s smoothness.

Practically, CNR enables rapid screening of Λ choices, selection of promising preconditioners, and sensitivity analysis via randomized interventions.

5. Noise-Aligned Preconditioning (NAP)
NAP implements the Noise Alignment Principle in standard training:

- Target covariance estimation: Online, per-layer estimation of prompt-level task covariance Σ̂β or feature covariance Σ̂φ via:
  - episodic batching with K > 1 exemplars per pseudo-task formed from adjacent spans,
  - low-rank sketches (rank r ≪ d) using incremental Oja updates,
  - diagonal correction to preserve per-parameter stability.

- Preconditioner: P is chosen from a stable family (e.g., Adafactor/Adam diagonal blocks) and Λt := P (UΣrU⊤ + λI) P, where UΣrU⊤ is the rank-r sketch.

- Noise injection: Implement via SGLD-style gradient perturbations or temperature scaling of minibatch stochasticity using microbatching to achieve the target Λt.

- Schedule: Increase alignment strength over training (curriculum), with temperature T decayed to control stationary variance.

Compatibility: NAP composes with Adam/Adafactor, gradient clipping, and mixed precision; overhead is minor (rank r = 8–64).

6. Experiments
We evaluate three questions: (Q1) Does NAP improve ICL without harming language modeling? (Q2) Does CNR accurately predict the effect of preconditioners and support causal claims? (Q3) What circuits emerge under aligned noise?

6.1 Synthetic meta-learning suite
- Tasks: Linear regression and classification with heteroscedastic priors; sequence copying and simple algorithmic patterns.
- Models: 2–8 layer transformers, 50–300M parameters.
- Findings: NAP matches the theoretical Bayes predictor under correct Σβ and degrades gracefully under misspecification; CNR selects near-optimal Λ among candidates with strong rank correlation to realized gains. Improvements are largest when K is small (few-shot).

6.2 Medium-scale language models
- Setup: Pretrain 1–7B parameter decoder-only models on standard corpora with episodic minibatching (K=4–8 exemplars) and apply NAP in attention and MLP output blocks. Baselines: AdamW, SGLD, Adadiffusion-like noise, and batch-size scaling.
- Metrics: Perplexity, ICL tasks (pattern completion, arithmetic with demonstrations, table-to-text), few-shot accuracy on standardized benchmarks, and OOD generalization with distribution shift in prompt statistics.
- Results: NAP increases few-shot accuracy while maintaining perplexity within baseline variance. Gains persist under ablations that swap NAP off late in training, supporting a training-time causal effect rather than a test-time artifact.

6.3 Causal analyses
- CNR validation: For held-out checkpoints, CNR’s predicted metric deltas under Λ swaps correlate with realized deltas after short finetunes; prediction intervals are well-calibrated.
- Randomized interventions: Mid-training noise-preconditioner swaps produce sharp changes in ICL metrics predicted by CNR; swapping only in non-ICL-relevant layers attenuates effects.
- Circuit knockouts: Temporarily ablating specific attention heads reduces ICL more in NAP models; linear probes reveal heads computing prompt-level sufficient statistics, consistent with Theorem 1.

Our work uniquely links aligned gradient noise to in-context Bayesian inference with proofs in transformer surrogates, introduces CNR for optimizer noise counterfactuals, and delivers a practical, scalable NAP optimizer guided by this theory.

8. Limitations
- Theory applies to linear-Gaussian task families and deep linear approximations; extensions to nonlinear regimes require further work.
- Online covariance estimation can be noisy under nonstationary corpora; adaptive rank selection and robust sketches may help.
- CNR relies on local linearization; far-from-trajectory counterfactuals can be inaccurate.

9. Broader Impacts
Shaping optimizer noise to favor ICL could amplify both helpful and harmful in-context adaptation. We recommend combining NAP with data governance to avoid encoding sensitive correlations and with evaluation for prompt injection robustness.

10. Conclusion
We present a causal and algorithmic account of how training-time noise structure shapes in-context learning. Aligning gradient noise covariance with task-family covariance yields in-context Bayesian inference in theory, a practical NAP optimizer in practice, and CNR tools to causally probe noise design without retraining. We hope this establishes a principled bridge between optimizer design and emergent ICL.

Reproducibility
We provide reference implementations of NAP and CNR with:
- rank-r sketching modules for per-layer covariance,
- SGLD-compatible noise injection wrappers for Adam/Adafactor,
- logging hooks for gradient covariance and CNR replay.
