Brief justification: This draft presents a highly novel theoretical and practical framework for understanding and enhancing in-context learning in LLMs through noise alignment, supported by rigorous proofs, scalable methods (CNR and NAP), and empirical validation. It avoids disallowed topics, demonstrates strong potential for publication in leading AI journals like NeurIPS or ICML due to its originality, causal insights, and reproducibility, with no major flaws in structure, evidence, or alignment with constraints.
