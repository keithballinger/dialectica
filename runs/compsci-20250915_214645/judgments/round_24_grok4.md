Brief justification: The revised draft presents a highly novel contribution by introducing PNE as a metric linking preconditioned SGN to ICL emergence, supported by rigorous causal interventions, mechanistic probes, and geometric analysis. The theory is well-formalized with equations, experiments are controlled and reproducible, and limitations are transparently addressed. This is publishable in a leading AI journal like NeurIPS or JMLR, with strong evidence for the claims and no major flaws.
