Brief justification: The revised draft is highly novel, presenting an original metric (PNE) and causal analysis linking preconditioned gradient noise to ICL in LLMs, with strong evidence from controlled experiments. It avoids blockchain topics, unifies related work effectively, and demonstrates publishable quality for a leading AI journal like NeurIPS or ICLR, with rigorous methodology, clear contributions, and reproducibility support. No major flaws or revisions needed.
