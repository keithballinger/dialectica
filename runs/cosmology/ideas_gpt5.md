Major Revisions

1) Primordial Bell Correlations in the CMB from Entangled Inflationary Initial States
Summary: Quantum-gravity–induced mode entanglement before or during inflation generates a phase-locked trispectrum that couples large- and small-scale E/B modes in a distinctive kernel.
For a smart layperson: If the universe’s earliest ripples were quantum-entangled, their fingerprints would show up as subtle, coordinated patterns in the polarization of the cosmic microwave background. These patterns link big and small swirls in a way ordinary physics cannot mimic. We can look for that very specific “dance step” in the CMB data.
Falsification: Build a Python pipeline (healpy, numpy, jax/camb) to simulate CMB maps with the predicted trispectrum kernel, derive an optimal estimator, and apply it to Planck/ACT/Simons Observatory maps; a null result with sensitivity below the predicted amplitude rules it out. Cross-check that lensing and foregrounds cannot fake the kernel by end-to-end simulations.
Novelty: Unlike previous non-Gaussian feature searches, this targets a concrete entanglement-induced trispectrum with fixed angle and scale dependence that cannot be produced by lensing or standard inflation.

2) Running Spatial Curvature from Quantum-Gravity Renormalization
Summary: The effective spatial curvature parameter K becomes scale- and time-dependent via renormalization-group flow, modifying distance-redshift relations and the BAO ruler.
For a smart layperson: Curvature might not be a single number for the whole universe; quantum effects could make it “run” with cosmic scale. That would subtly shift the apparent sizes of standard rulers as we look farther away. We can check if this running improves or worsens the fit to precise galaxy and supernova maps.
Falsification: Implement modified Friedmann equations with K(k∼aH) in Python (scipy ODEs) and compute observables (BAO distances, SN luminosity distances, CMB shift parameters) using CAMB/CLASS wrappers; if joint fits (emcee/numpyro) force the running parameter to zero with high significance, the theory is falsified.
Novelty: Prior work runs G or Λ, but a predictive scale-dependent curvature sector with explicit observational kernels for BAO/CMB distances is new.

3) Anomaly-Induced Chiral Gravitational Waves Leaving TB/EB Signatures
Summary: A quantum gravitational anomaly generates a chiral graviton chemical potential during reheating, imprinting frequency-dependent TB/EB correlations and circular polarization in the stochastic GW background.
For a smart layperson: If gravity slightly prefers left- over right-handed ripples due to deep quantum effects, it twists the CMB’s polarization pattern in a tell-tale way and biases the “handedness” of background gravitational waves. That bias has a fixed pattern in frequency and angle we can hunt for.
Falsification: Use Python to extend Boltzmann solvers (CLASS/CAMB via classy/cambpy) with chiral tensor transfer functions, simulate TB/EB spectra, and fit to Planck/BICEP/ACT; simultaneously compute the polarized SGWB and compare to LIGO/Virgo/KAGRA and PTA cross-correlations; exclusion of the anomaly coefficient beyond the predicted range falsifies it.
Novelty: This links a calculable anomaly coefficient to a joint CMB–GW polarization template with fixed spectral tilt, unlike generic parity-violation models.

4) Planck-Scale Diffraction Produces Energy-Scaled Speckle in Gamma-Ray Burst Light Curves
Summary: Discrete quantum geometry induces stochastic path-length phases that create a universal E−1 speckle scale in the second-order coherence of high-energy transient photons.
For a smart layperson: If spacetime is grainy, high-energy light from distant explosions should flicker with a specific, energy-dependent pattern, like a speckle effect. The higher the photon energy, the finer the speckle.
Falsification: Write a Python Monte Carlo (numpy, numba) to propagate photons through a stochastic phase screen calibrated by one Planck-scale parameter, generate predicted intensity autocorrelation functions across energy bands, and confront Fermi/Swift/CTA data; absence of the E−1 scaling at predicted amplitudes rules it out.
Novelty: It predicts a concrete, cross-band second-order coherence law tied to Planckian phase noise, not just mean time-of-flight dispersion.

5) Nonlocal Quantum-Gravity Form Factor Suppressing Small-Scale Structure
Summary: A causal, ghost-free nonlocal kernel modifies the Poisson equation, exponentially damping power below a length ℓQG and predicting a cutoff in the halo mass function and Lyman-α flux power.
For a smart layperson: Quantum gravity may smear gravity’s pull over tiny distances, blurring the formation of very small clumps of matter. This would leave fewer small halos and a smoother intergalactic medium than expected.
Falsification: Implement an N-body/PM code in Python (pyfftw, cupy/numba) with a modified Green’s function Φ(k)=−4πGρ(k)/(k2 eℓQG2k2), evolve cosmological boxes, and compare the halo mass function and Lyman-α P1D(k) with DESI/HIRES; constraints ℓQG→0 falsify the model at target sensitivity.
Novelty: Provides a specific, UV-complete-inspired transfer function and end-to-end structure-formation predictions rather than phenomenological warm dark matter analogues.

6) Holographic Shear Noise with Predictive Cross-Site Correlations
Summary: Finite information density of spacetime creates a transverse, shear-like metric noise with a calculable geodesic cross-correlation template between separated interferometers.
For a smart layperson: If space encodes information holographically, it should jitter in a correlated way that multiple detectors can “hear” together. The pattern of shared noise depends on their separation and orientation in a precise way.
Falsification: Simulate the predicted correlated stochastic field in Python (stationary Gaussian processes on Earth-centered frames), generate cross-spectra for LIGO/Virgo/KAGRA baselines, and compare to archived strain data; non-detection down to the predicted amplitude excludes the model.
Novelty: Unlike prior holographic-noise proposals, this yields a unique, geocentric baseline-dependent correlation template enabling definitive cross-site tests.

7) Bounce-Phase Memory: Log-Periodic Oscillations Coherent Across CMB and LSS
Summary: A quantum bounce preceding inflation imprints a fixed-phase, log-periodic modulation of the primordial spectrum that coherently appears in TT/TE/EE and the galaxy power spectrum.
For a smart layperson: If the Big Bang started with a bounce, it could leave ripples whose strength wiggles with scale in a regular, repeating way. Those wiggles should line up across different cosmic maps if they share the same origin.
Falsification: Implement a Python template P(k)=P0(k)[1+A cos(ω log(k/k0)+ϕ)] with phase-locked relations across spectra, propagate through CLASS, and jointly fit Planck/ACT/galaxy P(k) (desilike/numpyro); absence of a common phase-locked signal rules it out.
Novelty: Prior feature searches allow independent phases per observable; this enforces cross-observable phase coherence as a unique bounce signature.

8) Entanglement-Driven Running Planck Mass and Gravitational Slip
Summary: Quantum entanglement entropy flow induces a scale- and redshift-dependent effective Planck mass, producing a distinctive slip between metric potentials and modified growth-lensing consistency.
For a smart layperson: If gravity’s strength slowly changes with scale due to quantum effects, the motion of galaxies and the bending of light won’t match the usual pattern. Comparing those two provides a clean test.
Falsification: Solve linear perturbations with μ(k,z), γ(k,z) derived from MPl,eff(k,z) in Python (hi_class or custom ODEs), predict fσ8, weak-lensing Cℓ, and ISW; fit to DES/KiDS/SDSS/DESI and Planck lensing; if data force μ,γ→1 across scales, the model is excluded.
Novelty: Ties a concrete entanglement-flow Ansatz for MPl,eff to multi-probe slip predictions rather than generic EFT coefficients.

9) Quantum Gravity Black-Hole Remnants as Dark Matter Linked to a Broken SGWB
Summary: Planck-scale remnants from early black-hole evaporation yield a specific PBH mass function and a broken, nonthermal stochastic GW background with a calculable knee frequency.
For a smart layperson: Tiny black holes in the early universe might have stopped evaporating at the Planck scale, leaving relics that make up dark matter. Their birth and evaporation would also leave a background of gravitational waves with a sharp bend in strength versus frequency.
Falsification: Use Python to evolve PBH populations with QG-capped evaporation (scipy integrate), compute relic abundance and SGWB ΩGW(f) (numpy), and confront microlensing, CMB accretion limits, PTA and LIGO/Virgo spectra; if the required relic abundance is incompatible with SGWB bounds at the predicted knee, the theory fails.
Novelty: Predicts a joint, parameter-light relation between relic dark matter fraction and a broken SGWB spectrum uniquely tied to the QG evaporation halt.

10) Dimensional Flow at High Energies Alters Silk Damping and μ-Distortions
Summary: A reduction of the spectral dimension above a crossover scale modifies photon diffusion and viscosity in the early plasma, changing the CMB damping tail and generating a correlated μ-distortion amplitude.
For a smart layperson: If space effectively has fewer dimensions at very high energies, photons would have diffused differently before atoms formed. That leaves precise fingerprints in how small-scale CMB ripples are smoothed and in tiny distortions of its spectrum.
Falsification: Modify Thomson drag and diffusion terms in a Python Boltzmann solver (CLASS via Python interface) using a spectral-dimension flow dS(E), fit Planck/ACT damping-tail data, and compute μ with CosmoTherm-like Python wrappers; joint constraints excluding the required dS-flow falsify the model.
Novelty: Connects dimensional flow directly to recombination microphysics with a fixed joint prediction for high-ℓ CMB and μ-distortions, beyond generic varying-constants models.
