This revised draft effectively addresses prior concerns by providing rigorous derivations (e.g., arcsin law for Bell statistic), explicit kernel definitions, detailed simulation protocols, and quantified systematics handling. It demonstrates high novelty in probing primordial quantumness via CMB trispectra, with Python-based validation ensuring reproducibility. The content is evidence-based, comprehensive, and suitable for publication in a leading cosmology journal like Physical Review D or JCAP, meeting all specified constraints.
