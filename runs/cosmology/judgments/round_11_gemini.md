The authors have comprehensively addressed all previous concerns. The revised manuscript is a significant improvement and presents a compelling, novel, and robust analysis. The link between the continuous EB coupling and the dichotomic CHSH statistic is now rigorously established via the arcsin law. The kernel, estimator, and bias-hardening framework are explicitly and correctly defined for realistic survey conditions. The systematic and validation sections are thorough, and the commitment to full reproducibility is commendable. The paper is now suitable for publication.
