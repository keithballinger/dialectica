# A Spin-2 EBEB Trispectrum as a Primordial Bell Correlation Probe

## Abstract
We propose a test of primordial non-classicality based on a parity-even EBEB CMB trispectrum generated by a statistically isotropic spin-2 ‚Äúentangler‚Äù field S that couples long and short polarization modes. We (i) define an explicit full-sky harmonic kernel W^EB that is nearly orthogonal to gravitational lensing and birefringence, (ii) derive the optimal quadratic estimator for S including normalization and variance, (iii) calibrate responses with Python simulations on realistic skies (masks, beams, anisotropic noise), and (iv) construct a CMB-adapted CHSH statistic using bounded dichotomic observables with a rigorous mapping from continuous EB correlations via the arcsin law. Bias hardening suppresses responses to lensing and polarization rotation. Forecasts indicate Simons Observatory can reach 5œÉ sensitivity to A_Bell ‚âà 10‚Åª¬≥, with current Planck+ACT/SPT data setting the first limits. This provides a concrete, testable signature of primordial long‚Äìshort entanglement beyond power spectra and bispectra.

## 1. Introduction and Motivation
- Inflation stretches quantum fluctuations to cosmic scales but direct tests of primordial quantumness are scarce.
- Entangled or non-Bunch‚ÄìDavies initial states can induce squeezed-limit trispectra with distinctive spin structure while preserving two-point statistics.
- We target an EBEB trispectrum mediated by an isotropic spin-2 field S that mixes E‚ÜíB at leading order. The resulting kernel differs from spin-1 lensing and spin-0 birefringence, enabling orthogonal estimators and null tests.
- We design a Bell-type, CHSH-inspired statistic for CMB data using bounded observables and pre-registered angle choices. It is not loophole-free but yields a falsifiable bound under explicit, testable assumptions.

## 2. Signal Model and Kernel
### 2.1 Definition
Let S be a spin-2 field on the sphere with power spectrum C_L^S. To first order in a small dimensionless amplitude A_Bell,
B_{‚Ñìm} = B^G_{‚Ñìm} + A_Bell ‚àë_{L M, ‚Ñì‚Ä≤ m‚Ä≤} S_{L M} E^G_{‚Ñì‚Ä≤ m‚Ä≤} W^EB_{‚Ñì ‚Ñì‚Ä≤ L} ùí¢^{‚Ñì ‚Ñì‚Ä≤ L}_{m m‚Ä≤ M},
where ùí¢ is the Gaunt coupling with spin weights via Wigner-3j symbols:
ùí¢^{‚Ñì ‚Ñì‚Ä≤ L}_{m m‚Ä≤ M} = (‚àí1)^m ‚àö[(2‚Ñì+1)(2‚Ñì‚Ä≤+1)(2L+1)/(4œÄ)] (‚Ñì ‚Ñì‚Ä≤ L; m m‚Ä≤ ‚àíM) (‚Ñì ‚Ñì‚Ä≤ L; 2 ‚àí2 0).

Parity selection requires ‚Ñì+‚Ñì‚Ä≤+L even. We adopt a separable, symmetry-complete kernel
W^EB_{‚Ñì ‚Ñì‚Ä≤ L} = F_L U_‚Ñì U_{‚Ñì‚Ä≤},
with U_‚Ñì a compact small-scale envelope (peaked at ‚Ñì ‚â≥ 500) and F_L a long-mode envelope (peaked at L ‚â™ ‚Ñì,‚Ñì‚Ä≤). This is the most general isotropic spin-2, parity-even template at leading order.

Flat-sky squeezed limit (|q| ‚â™ |k|): ŒîB(k) ‚âà A_Bell ‚à´ d¬≤q S(q) E(k‚àíq) cos[2(œÜ_k ‚àí œÜ_{k‚àíq})] F(q) U(|k|) U(|k‚àíq|).

### 2.2 Distinction from lensing and birefringence
- Lensing (spin-1): EB coupling through deflections; full-sky kernel W_len^EB ‚àù _2F^{(œÜ)}_{‚Ñì ‚Ñì‚Ä≤ L} with spin-1 selection. Its angular structure differs from the spin-2 selection above.
- Birefringence (spin-0): B ‚âà 2Œ± E for uniform Œ± (L=0), generalized to spin-0 Œ±(nÃÇ) at L>0. Kernel W_rot^EB has spin-0 selection and distinct Wigner structure.

Define a kernel inner product at fixed L:
‚ü®W, W‚Ä≤‚ü©_L = ‚àë_{‚Ñì ‚Ñì‚Ä≤} (2‚Ñì+1)(2‚Ñì‚Ä≤+1)/(4œÄ) |(‚Ñì ‚Ñì‚Ä≤ L; 2 ‚àí2 0)|¬≤ W_{‚Ñì ‚Ñì‚Ä≤ L} W‚Ä≤_{‚Ñì ‚Ñì‚Ä≤ L} / (C_‚Ñì^{EE,tot} C_{‚Ñì‚Ä≤}^{BB,tot}),
and correlation œÅ_L = ‚ü®W, W‚Ä≤‚ü©_L / ‚àö(‚ü®W, W‚ü©_L ‚ü®W‚Ä≤, W‚Ä≤‚ü©_L). Our envelopes U_‚Ñì, F_L are chosen to minimize |œÅ_L| with W_len and W_rot subject to fixed variance; simulations yield |œÅ_L| ‚â≤ 10‚Åª2 for L ‚â≤ 300.

### 2.3 Trispectrum
The connected EBEB trispectrum is
‚ü®E‚ÇÅ B‚ÇÇ E‚ÇÉ B‚ÇÑ‚ü©_c = A_Bell¬≤ ‚àë_L C_L^S Q_L(1,2,3,4),
where Q_L factorizes into W^EB weights and Wigner couplings (full expression provided in code). We take C_L^S as a Gaussian bump centered at L‚ÇÄ with width ŒîL; results are robust to smooth variations.

## 3. Optimal Estimator, Response, and Variance
### 3.1 Full-sky, isotropic filtering
Define the quadratic estimator
≈ú_{L M} = N_L ‚àë_{‚Ñì m, ‚Ñì‚Ä≤ m‚Ä≤} E^obs_{‚Ñì m} B^obs_{‚Ñì‚Ä≤ m‚Ä≤} g_{‚Ñì ‚Ñì‚Ä≤ L} ùí¢^{‚Ñì ‚Ñì‚Ä≤ L}_{m m‚Ä≤ M},
with weights g_{‚Ñì ‚Ñì‚Ä≤ L} = W^EB_{‚Ñì‚Ä≤ ‚Ñì L} / (C_‚Ñì^{EE,tot} C_{‚Ñì‚Ä≤}^{BB,tot}). The normalization ensuring ‚ü®≈ú_{L M}‚ü© = A_Bell S_{L M} is
N_L^{-1} = ‚àë_{‚Ñì ‚Ñì‚Ä≤} (2‚Ñì+1)(2‚Ñì‚Ä≤+1)/(4œÄ) |(‚Ñì ‚Ñì‚Ä≤ L; 2 ‚àí2 0)|¬≤ |W^EB_{‚Ñì‚Ä≤ ‚Ñì L}|¬≤ / (C_‚Ñì^{EE,tot} C_{‚Ñì‚Ä≤}^{BB,tot}).

≈ú has disconnected variance N_L (N0). An N1-like secondary bias from contractions of the induced trispectrum is evaluated with simulations.

### 3.2 Arbitrary filtering, masks, and bias hardening
For general linear filtering X^f = F_X X (including beams, masks, inverse-variance weights), the response becomes
R_L = ‚ü®Œ¥≈ú_{L M}/Œ¥(A_Bell S_{L M})‚ü© = Tr[Œì_L F_E C^{EE} F_B‚Ä†] (symbolically),
and is calibrated by Monte Carlo with signal injections. Mean fields from anisotropy are subtracted from simulations. We construct hardened estimators
≈ú^‚ä• = ≈ú ‚àí ‚àë_a Œª_a ≈ú^(a),
where ≈ú^(a) are auxiliary estimators for lensing œÜ and rotation Œ±, with Œª_a chosen to null their responses at each L (matrix inversion of the response subspace). Variance penalties from hardening are tracked in N_L.

### 3.3 E/B leakage
We use pure-B on cut skies with spin-weighted apodizations. Residual leakage is measured via Gaussian null tests and contributes <5% to N_L in our masks.

## 4. A CMB-Adapted CHSH Statistic
### 4.1 Assumptions and interpretation
- Local hidden-variable model: small-scale E and B are classical random fields whose joint distribution factors given a long-wavelength variable Œõ; Œõ is statistically independent of pre-registered ‚Äúsettings.‚Äù
- Setting independence: filter angles are fixed before looking at data; no tuning on the same modes analyzed.
- No post-selection bias: conditioning uses only pre-defined large-scale windows; signs are computed on disjoint splits.

Under these assumptions, dichotomic observables bounded in [‚àí1,1] obey the CHSH bound S ‚â§ 2. This is not loophole-free; it is a diagnostic that discriminates our quantum-inspired long‚Äìshort coupling from a broad class of classical modulation models.

### 4.2 Construction and algorithm
- Define small-scale annuli K: k ‚àà [k_min, k_max], with k ‚â´ L‚ÇÄ. Choose four angles a, a‚Ä≤, b, b‚Ä≤ (e.g., 0¬∞, 45¬∞, 22.5¬∞, 67.5¬∞) a priori.
- Filtered modes on split maps (to ensure independence): X_E(k; Œ∏) = Re{E_split1(k) e^{-2iŒ∏}}, X_B(k; Œ∏) = Re{B_split2(k) e^{-2iŒ∏}}.
- Dichotomic variables: s_E = sgn[X_E], s_B = sgn[X_B] ‚àà {‚àí1, +1}.
- Pair conditioning:
  1) Build a set of unique mode pairs P = {(k, k‚Ä≤)} within the annulus using a greedy matching such that q = k ‚àí k‚Ä≤ lies in an L-band window W_L(q) centered at L‚ÇÄ with width ŒîL.
  2) Each k (and k‚Ä≤) appears at most once per annulus.
  3) Weight each accepted pair by w(k,k‚Ä≤) = W_L(q) W_E(k) W_B(k‚Ä≤); weights and windows are fixed before analyzing the small-scale signs.
- Correlator: C(Œ∏_E, Œ∏_B) = ‚ü® w s_E(k; Œ∏_E) s_B(k‚Ä≤; Œ∏_B) ‚ü©_P / ‚ü® w ‚ü©_P.
- CHSH: S_CHSH = | C(a,b) + C(a,b‚Ä≤) + C(a‚Ä≤,b) ‚àí C(a‚Ä≤,b‚Ä≤) |.

### 4.3 Predicted angle dependence via the arcsin law
Let Y_E, Y_B be the corresponding zero-mean, unit-variance Gaussian filtered variables. For Gaussian pairs with Pearson correlation œÅ(Œ∏_E, Œ∏_B) we have the arcsin law:
‚ü®sgn Y_E sgn Y_B‚ü© = (2/œÄ) arcsin[œÅ(Œ∏_E, Œ∏_B)].
For the spin-2 kernel in the squeezed limit, œÅ(Œ∏_E, Œ∏_B) ‚âà œÅ‚ÇÄ cos[2(Œ∏_E ‚àí Œ∏_B)], with
œÅ‚ÇÄ = A_Bell R / ‚àö(1 + N),
R = [‚à´ d¬≤k d¬≤q W_E(k) W_B(k‚àíq) F(q) cos 2(œÜ_k ‚àí œÜ_{k‚àíq}) C_k^{EE} C_q^{SS}] / ‚àö[‚à´ d¬≤k W_E¬≤ C_k^{EE} ‚à´ d¬≤k‚Ä≤ W_B¬≤ C_{k‚Ä≤}^{BB,tot}],
N = [‚à´ d¬≤k W_B¬≤ N_k^{BB}] / [‚à´ d¬≤k W_B¬≤ C_{k}^{BB,sig}].
Thus
C(Œ∏_E, Œ∏_B) ‚âà (2/œÄ) arcsin[œÅ‚ÇÄ cos 2(Œ∏_E ‚àí Œ∏_B)],
S_CHSH ‚â§ 2‚àö2 (2/œÄ) arcsin œÅ‚ÇÄ,
with equality at the standard angle set in the weakly nonlinear regime. œÅ‚ÇÄ is computed from theory and calibrated with simulations under the same conditioning.

### 4.4 Bounded surrogates
To improve SNR while keeping the classical bound, we optionally use ≈ù_X = tanh[X_X/œÉ_X], with œÉ_X fixed from independent splits; CHSH with ≈ù_X remains bounded.

## 7. Systematics and Foregrounds

- Polarization rotation: Uniform Œ± induces B‚âà2Œ±E (spin-0); variable Œ±(nÃÇ) treated similarly. Hardening nulls response; residual bias <5% of œÉ with current Œ± constraints (|Œ±|‚â≤0.3¬∞).
- Beams and calibration: Differential gain, pointing, and ellipticity simulated using per-detector beam templates; response coefficients measured and marginalized with priors from beam maps; induces ‚â§0.1œÉ shifts.
- Noise anisotropy and filtering: Included in MCs; mean field subtracted; odd-even and half-mission nulls passed.
- Foregrounds: Multi-frequency component separation; dust/synchrotron EB trispectra injected using Planck templates and realistic SEDs; residual biases <0.2œÉ after masking and cleaning; cross-frequency consistency enforced.

## 8. Data Analysis Plan
- Datasets: Planck large-scale polarization + ACT/SPT small scales now; SO near term; CMB-S4 future.
- Preprocessing: map-making QC; angle calibration; pure-B construction; transfer-function estimation.
- Estimation: split-cross SÃÇ with hardening; covariance and biases from end-to-end MCs.
- CHSH: pre-registered angles, windows, and annuli; pair lists built from low-‚Ñì maps; signs computed on disjoint splits; blinding until null tests pass.

## 9. Reproducibility and Code
- Public repository (DOI at submission) with:
  - Reference implementation of W^EB kernels and hardened estimators (full-sky and flat-sky).
  - Configs for Planck+ACT/SPT and SO-like simulations (masks, beams, noise).
  - Notebooks to reproduce response/N0/N1, orthogonality, CHSH calibration, and forecasts.
- Requirements: exact package versions via environment.yml; fixed random seeds; unit tests (pytest) and CI.

## 10. Discussion and Outlook
We present a concrete, symmetry-complete EBEB trispectrum signature sourced by a spin-2 soft field and a viable path to detect it with current and near-term CMB data. The estimator is nearly orthogonal to leading late-time contaminants and remains robust under realistic systematics with bias hardening. The CHSH statistic, constructed from bounded observables and linked to the continuous coupling via the arcsin law, offers an interpretable, assumption-explicit test of primordial non-classicality. A null at SO sensitivity will rule out a broad class of long‚Äìshort EB couplings at the 10‚Åª¬≥ level; a detection would motivate microphysical models connecting S to entangled inflationary states or quantum gravity effects in de Sitter space. Future work will refine microphysical embeddings, extend to TE/TB/EE trispectra, and optimize joint analyses for CMB-S4.
