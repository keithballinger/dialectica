1) Score: 9/10 — A highly novel and falsifiable test linking quantum entanglement to a unique CMB trispectrum kernel.
2) Score: 8/10 — A solid, testable model that applies the concept of running constants to spatial curvature with clear LSS predictions.
3) Score: 9/10 — This presents a powerful multi-messenger test linking a QG anomaly to specific, correlated signatures in CMB and GW polarization.
4) Score: 9/10 — Proposes a creative and specific test of spacetime granularity via a novel speckle signature in GRB light curves.
5) Score: 8/10 — A well-defined model with clear predictions for small-scale structure, though N-body simulations in Python pose a moderate feasibility challenge.
6) Score: 10/10 — This idea elevates holographic noise from a vague concept to a superbly falsifiable hypothesis with a unique cross-correlation template.
7) Score: 8/10 — Strengthens prior bounce searches by demanding a unique cross-observable phase coherence between the CMB and LSS.
8) Score: 9/10 — Connects a fundamental QG entropy concept to a clean, falsifiable gravitational slip signature in cosmological survey data.
9) Score: 8/10 — A compelling scenario that tightly links PBH remnant dark matter to a specific, broken stochastic gravitational-wave background.
10) Score: 9/10 — A novel connection between dimensional flow and recombination physics, yielding a tight, joint prediction for the CMB damping tail and μ-distortions.
