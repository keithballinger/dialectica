1) Score: 8/10 — Minor Revisions: Highly novel entanglement-specific trispectrum with a clean estimator and Python simulation path is falsifiable on CMB data, but needs clearer amplitude priors and rigorous lensing/foreground null tests.
2) Score: 6/10 — Major Revisions: Concept is intriguing but theoretical consistency of scale/time-dependent K in FRW and degeneracies with dark energy reduce novelty and falsifiability unless a tightly predicted running kernel is derived and confronted with distances.
3) Score: 7/10 — Minor Revisions: Concrete anomaly coefficient mapping to joint TB/EB and polarized SGWB is novel and testable with CLASS extensions, but current TB/EB limits and foreground systematics temper feasibility and require careful multi-dataset fits.
4) Score: 6/10 — Major Revisions: Planck-scale speckle is novel and falsifiable via energy-scaled second-order coherence, yet photon statistics, instrumental systematics, and limited HBT sensitivity for GRBs make feasibility challenging without a robust detectability forecast.
5) Score: 7/10 — Major Revisions: A specific nonlocal Poisson kernel is testable in modified PM simulations and Lyman-α/halo statistics, but novelty over WDM/baryon feedback and stability/causality proofs must be sharpened to avoid degeneracy-driven nulls.
6) Score: 7/10 — Minor Revisions: Baseline-dependent holographic shear cross-correlations are distinctive and falsifiable with archived interferometer data and Python GP simulations, though previous nulls and environmental correlations demand stringent null controls.
7) Score: 6/10 — Major Revisions: Log-periodic, phase-coherent features are testable and simulable, but novelty over existing resonant/clock/bounce feature searches is limited unless the phase-locking is tied to a unique bounce parameter relation.
8) Score: 6/10 — Major Revisions: Multi-probe slip from an entanglement-driven MPl(k,z) is in principle falsifiable with hi_class, yet theoretical grounding and distinction from generic EFT μ–γ parameterizations need much clearer, predictive structure.
9) Score: 7/10 — Minor Revisions: The remnant–SGWB knee linkage is relatively novel and falsifiable with PTA/LIGO plus relic abundance codes, but must confront tight PBH constraints and reheating uncertainties with a minimal-parameter prediction.
10) Score: 7/10 — Minor Revisions: Dimensional-flow impacts on Silk damping and μ are novel and testable via CLASS+CosmoTherm-like wrappers, but feasibility hinges on a self-consistent microphysical dS(E) model rather than an ad hoc scaling.
