The draft proposes a highly novel, retraining-free method for adaptive LLM decoding using MC-dropout to gate between greedy and sampling modes, with strong potential impact on inference quality, performance, and agentic workflows. It provides clear pseudocode implementable on small open-source models and a rigorous, falsifiable experimental plan, rendering it publishable in a leading journal like NeurIPS or ICML.
