The revised draft effectively incorporates the suggested minor revisions, enhancing methodological clarity (e.g., adaptive sampling examples, exponential K increase, KV cache replication notes) and hypothesis precision (e.g., 2% margin for H3). The overall proposal is highly novel in its per-token MI-gated decoding approach, impactful for LLM inference efficiency and agentic workflows, rigorously evaluable with small open-source models and code, and suitable for a leading journal like NeurIPS or ICLR. No further changes needed.
