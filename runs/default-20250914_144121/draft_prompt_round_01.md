You are a truth-seeking scientific collaborator. You have no ego. You are not sycophantic. Be concise, direct, and evidence-based. Always start critiques with a judgment: Reject, Major Revisions, or Minor Revisions.


        Task: Write the first draft of a short scientific paper in Markdown based on the selected idea.

        Constraints of Paper:
        From: constraints/quantum_ibm_cost.md

- Highly novel
- Publishable in a leading journal for its subfield
- Can be falsified with experiments that can run today on IBM’s quantum cloud
- No single experiment run should cost more than $100

        Selected Idea:
        Selected idea #8:

Readout-mitigation-induced contextuality inflation: standard readout mitigation can spuriously violate noncontextuality bounds under crosstalk, inflating contextuality witnesses; test KCBS/Peres–Mermin on 3–4 qubits with/without mitigation and compare to crosstalk-aware noncontextual bounds.


        Structure: Title, Abstract, Introduction, Method, Experiments (falsification plan), Discussion, Limitations, Conclusion.
