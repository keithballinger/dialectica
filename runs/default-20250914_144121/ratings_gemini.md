1.  **Novelty**: 8/10 — Proposes a specific microscopic mechanism (spectator-activated TLS) for non-exponential dephasing, a departure from simpler noise models.
    **Falsifiability**: 9/10 — The hypothesis makes a clear prediction about the stretched-exponential exponent changing with spectator load, which is directly testable with Ramsey experiments.
    **Feasibility**: 10/10 — Ramsey experiments are extremely fast and require few shots, placing the total cost far below the $100 limit.

2.  **Novelty**: 9/10 — Formulating a quantitative, predictive law for nonlocal dephasing based on resonator frequencies is a highly novel step beyond generic crosstalk analysis.
    **Falsifiability**: 8/10 — The experiment is simple, but the predicted dephasing effect may be small and challenging to resolve above the baseline T2* noise floor.
    **Feasibility**: 10/10 — Dynamic-circuit Ramsey experiments are short, and the required parameter sweeps are small, ensuring low cost.

3.  **Novelty**: 7/10 — While phase quantization is a known digital-control effect, its direct experimental characterization as a source of coherent error in quantum circuits is novel.
    **Falsifiability**: 9/10 — The predicted sawtooth phase error provides a unique experimental signature that is qualitatively distinct from standard continuous-phase error models.
    **Feasibility**: 10/10 — Circuits composed of many single-qubit gates are among the cheapest to run on quantum hardware.

4.  **Novelty**: 9/10 — The hypothesis of pairwise-correlated leakage, driven by a specific physical mechanism (CR spectral wings), presents a new and important error channel for two-qubit gates.
    **Falsifiability**: 8/10 — The super-product coincidence rate of |2⟩ states is a clear signature, but its detection requires well-calibrated and non-standard measurements to discriminate the |2⟩ state.
    **Feasibility**: 9/10 — The required circuits are short and the measurement scheme, while not default, is achievable with existing control, keeping costs low.

5.  **Novelty**: 8/10 — Modeling quantum errors as a renewal process with power-law statistics is a significant conceptual departure from standard Markovian error models.
    **Falsifiability**: 7/10 — The predicted superexponential decay is a unique signature, but it may be difficult to distinguish from other non-Markovian models at the long circuit depths where noise dominates.
    **Feasibility**: 8/10 — Randomized benchmarking can become costly with many sequences and long depths, but a targeted search for the effect is likely within budget.

6.  **Novelty**: 10/10 — Observing any signature of the measurement-induced phase transition on a real quantum processor would be a landmark result connecting quantum information and many-body physics.
    **Falsifiability**: 7/10 — The critical "kink" in entropy is predicted for the thermodynamic limit and may be washed out into a smooth crossover by the strong finite-size effects on 5–7 qubits.
    **Feasibility**: 7/10 — Classical shadow tomography requires a large number of measurement settings and shots, pushing the experimental cost toward the upper limit of the budget.

7.  **Novelty**: 8/10 — The idea that randomized compiling invariance is broken by coherent, long-range ZZ crosstalk is a subtle and novel challenge to a widely used error suppression technique.
    **Falsifiability**: 9/10 — The experiment directly tests a core assumption by correlating measured fidelity fluctuations with a specific, independently measurable parameter (ZZ coupling).
    **Feasibility**: 10/10 — The experiment consists of running standard circuits and performing standard ZZ characterization, both of which are low-cost.

8.  **Novelty**: 9/10 — Connecting a standard error mitigation protocol to the artificial inflation of a foundational property like contextuality is a highly novel and important insight.
    **Falsifiability**: 10/10 — The hypothesis is directly falsified by running a standard KCBS test with and without standard mitigation, a simple and unambiguous comparison.
    **Feasibility**: 10/10 — Contextuality tests on 3–4 qubits are extremely cheap due to the small number of short circuits required.

9.  **Novelty**: 7/10 — While imperfect Loschmidt echoes are expected, attributing the degradation to a specific many-body mechanism like drive-induced quasiparticles is a novel physical model for coherent gate error.
    **Falsifiability**: 8/10 — The central claim of excess echo infidelity beyond T1/T2 predictions is directly testable, though isolating the proposed cause from other coherent errors is challenging.
    **Feasibility**: 9/10 — The required echo sequences are composed of standard gates and are inexpensive to run at the moderate depths needed to observe the effect.

10. **Novelty**: 9/10 — Using the heavy-tailed statistics of a classical shadow estimator to probe the non-Gaussian nature of the underlying physical dephasing is a novel, cross-disciplinary approach.
    **Falsifiability**: 9/10 — The prediction of a power-law tail in the estimator's error distribution is a clear, quantitative signature that can be directly tested with sufficient statistics.
    **Feasibility**: 10/10 — Taking thousands of single-qubit classical shadows is computationally trivial and extremely low-cost on cloud hardware.
