Selected idea #8:

Readout-mitigation-induced contextuality inflation: standard readout mitigation can spuriously violate noncontextuality bounds under crosstalk, inflating contextuality witnesses; test KCBS/Peres–Mermin on 3–4 qubits with/without mitigation and compare to crosstalk-aware noncontextual bounds.
