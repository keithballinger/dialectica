Minor Revisions

1. Score: 9/10 — Highly novel in connecting sparse TLS to Lévy-stable dephasing via spectator activity, directly falsifiable through Ramsey fits on IBM quantum cloud with few qubits and low circuit depth ensuring costs under $100, though minor clarification needed on exact spectator configurations.

2. Score: 8/10 — Novel exploration of nonlocal dephasing tied to readout frequencies, falsifiable via targeted Ramsey experiments with variable-distance measurements on IBM devices, feasible within budget but requires validation of detuning correlations to avoid overcounting shots.

3. Score: 7/10 — Moderately novel in proposing digital quantization of virtual-Z phases, falsifiable with interferometer tests inserting VZ gates on IBM, but feasibility is borderline due to potential high shot counts for observing sawtooth patterns without exceeding $100 per run.

4. Score: 9/10 — Novel mechanism for correlated leakage under cross-resonance, falsifiable through two-qubit benchmarking with parallel CXs on IBM's heavy-hex lattice, highly feasible with small qubit counts and standard protocols keeping costs low.

5. Score: 8/10 — Novel application of renewal processes to non-Markovian errors in RB, falsifiable via long-depth benchmarking with idle inserts on IBM, feasible under constraints though long circuits may approach cost limits without optimization.

6. Score: 7/10 — Somewhat novel in probing finite-size entanglement transitions on heavy-hex, falsifiable with dynamic circuits and shadow entropy on 5-7 qubits via IBM cloud, but feasibility challenged by shot requirements for reliable entropy estimation within $100.

7. Score: 9/10 — Highly novel in revealing compilation non-invariance from ZZ interactions, falsifiable by testing multiple RC seeds against ZZ maps on IBM, easily feasible with modest circuit repetitions and low per-run costs.

8. Score: 8/10 — Novel insight into mitigation inflating contextuality under crosstalk, falsifiable via KCBS/Peres-Mermin tests on 3-4 qubits with/without mitigation on IBM, feasible but needs careful crosstalk modeling to fit budget.

9. Score: 9/10 — Novel asymmetry in Loschmidt echoes from quasiparticles, falsifiable through depth-varying echo experiments with controls on IBM, highly feasible with two-qubit setups and controlled depths staying under $100.

10. Score: 8/10 — Novel use of shadows to detect non-Gaussian dephasing tails, falsifiable via large-sample shadow tomography on one qubit with spectator load on IBM, feasible though 10^3-10^4 shots may require batching to avoid single-run cost overruns.
