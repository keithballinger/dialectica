1. Lévy-stable dephasing from sparse TLS activated by spectator activity: coherence decays as a stretched exponential with exponent changing when spectators run random Cliffords; test via Ramsey on one qubit while toggling 0–6 spectators’ random-Clifford load and fit Lévy vs exponential. 
2. Nonlocal measurement-induced dephasing with distance/frequency law: simultaneous mid-circuit readout of neighbors adds target phase variance proportional to readout-resonator frequency proximity; test by Ramsey on a target while measuring varying-distance qubits and correlating dephasing with readout detunings. 
3. Digital Z-frame quantization: cumulative virtual-Z phases have finite-resolution accumulation, yielding a sawtooth phase error versus VZ count; test by inserting many VZ(π/2) in an interferometer and observing linear-plus-sawtooth drift absent in continuous-phase models. 
4. Correlated leakage propagation under cross-resonance: CR spectral wings cause pairwise-correlated |2⟩ leakage across coupled qubits; test via two-qubit leakage benchmarking while running parallel CXs on neighbors and detect superproduct |2⟩ coincidence rates. 
5. Renewal-process non-Markovianity in Clifford circuits: inter-error waiting times follow a power law, predicting superexponential RB decay at short lengths and late-time plateaus; test with long-depth randomized benchmarking plus idle inserts and compare to exponential/bi-exponential fits. 
6. Finite-size measurement-induced entanglement transition on heavy-hex: there is a critical mid-circuit measurement rate p_c where stabilizer entropy of outputs shows a kink; test on a 5–7 qubit chain using dynamic circuits with variable per-qubit measurement probability and classical-shadow entropy. 
7. Compilation non-invariance from coherent long-range ZZ: average circuit fidelity depends systematically on randomized-compiling seed via interference with residual ZZ, violating compilation invariance; test by many RC seeds of the same circuit and correlate fidelity with measured ZZ map. 
8. Readout-mitigation-induced contextuality inflation: standard readout mitigation can spuriously violate noncontextuality bounds under crosstalk, inflating contextuality witnesses; test KCBS/Peres–Mermin on 3–4 qubits with/without mitigation and compare to crosstalk-aware noncontextual bounds. 
9. Loschmidt-echo time asymmetry from drive-induced quasiparticles: forward–inverse CX sequences fail to refocus beyond T1/T2 predictions, with asymmetry growing with CX count; test two-qubit Loschmidt echoes versus depth and contrast with depth-matched idle controls. 
10. Non-Gaussian dephasing revealed by shadow-error heavy tails: if dephasing is dominated by sparse telegraph noise, the distribution of single-qubit classical-shadow estimator errors has a power-law tail; test by 10^3–10^4 random-basis shadows on one qubit and tail-exponent fitting versus spectator load.
