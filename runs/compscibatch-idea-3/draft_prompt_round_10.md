        Minor Revisions

The revised draft is a strong improvement, addressing the core positional alignment issue correctly with relative offsets, expanding baselines, adding ablations, and providing pseudo-code for reproducibility. It meets novelty and validation constraints for LLM inference. Minor issues include: inconsistent notation (e.g., S_{ℓh} vs. S_ℓ; clarify if adapters are per-head or shared); incomplete CP-KVP acronym expansion in abstract; vague "block-diagonal per head with low-rank updates" without specifying rank; and missing explicit success criteria validation in experiments (report if met). Tighten these for publication.

# Warm-Starting Transformer Inference via Position-Consistent Linear Projection of KV Summaries

## Abstract
First-token latency in autoregressive transformers is dominated by the O(T^2) prefill over T prompt tokens. Exact KV cache reuse removes this cost only for identical prefixes. We propose CP-KVP (Cross-Prompt Key-Value Projection), a method that extends cache reuse to semantically similar prompts by (i) learning a linear compression that maps per-layer KV tensors into m summary slots with explicit position handling, and (ii) learning a linear projector that transfers summaries across prompts. A key technical contribution is a position-consistent alignment for RoPE and absolute embeddings: rather than inheriting absolute slot indices from a source prompt, we preserve relative offsets to the last prompt token, which is what next-token attention depends on. At inference, we retrieve a similar prompt, project its summary to the target, align slot positions by relative offsets, and compute the first new token using only a single forward pass—skipping the full prefill. We provide a reproducible protocol on small open-source models, a reference implementation with position_id overrides, and pre-registered falsification criteria balancing latency gains against distributional drift and task quality.

## 1. Introduction
- **Problem**: Prefill is the dominant cost for first-token latency; cache reuse is limited to exact string prefixes.
- **Hypothesis**: For semantically similar prompts, the effect of the prefix on the next-token computation lies on a low-dimensional, locally linear manifold per head/layer; a learned linear map can transfer compact cache summaries between prompts.
- **Key insight on positions**: For next-token attention, what matters is the relative offset between the last token’s query and keys. RoPE attention is equivariant to global position translation; preserving relative offsets (not absolute indices) is therefore the correct alignment.
- **Contributions**:
  1) A linear KV compression producing m-slot summaries that preserve last-position attention outputs, with explicit storage of relative offsets.
  2) A cross-prompt linear projector learned from paraphrase pairs to transfer summaries.
  3) An inference pipeline that replaces O(T^2) prefill with retrieval + projection + a single-token forward pass, plus an optional background exact prefill.
  4) A reproducible protocol with pre-registered success/failure criteria on small open-source models.

## 2. Method
### 2.1 Notation and setting
- Decoder-only transformer with L layers, H heads, head dimension d.
- For prompt p of length T, at layer ℓ and head h:
  - Keys K_{ℓh} ∈ R^{T×d}, Values V_{ℓh} ∈ R^{T×d}.
  - The last-prompt-position query Q^{(T)}_{ℓh}(p) is formed online.
- We choose m ≪ T summary slots per head. Let S_{ℓh}(p) := (K'_{ℓh}(p), V'_{ℓh}(p)) with K', V' ∈ R^{m×d}. For projection, concatenate per-head summaries within a layer: S_ℓ(p) ∈ R^{m×(2Hd)} by stacking [K'|V'] across heads.

### 2.2 Linear compression C with relative-offset bookkeeping
**Goal**: Given (K_{ℓh}, V_{ℓh}) and T, produce (K'_{ℓh}, V'_{ℓh}) that approximately preserves the attention output at the last prompt position.

**Length-agnostic pooling with linear adapters**:
- Fixed pooling W_T ∈ R^{m×T} on normalized positions u_t = t/T using triangular bases centered at c_j = (j − 0.5)/m:
  - W_T[j, t] = max(0, 1 − |u_t − c_j|/Δ), Δ = 1/m; rows normalized.
- Per-layer, per-head linear adapters A^K_{ℓh}, A^V_{ℓh} ∈ R^{d×d} (not shared across heads):
  - K'_{ℓh} = (W_T K_{ℓh}) A^K_{ℓh}
  - V'_{ℓh} = (W_T V_{ℓh}) A^V_{ℓh}

**Relative-offset storage**:
- Compute slot centers in absolute indices t̂_{ℓh,j} = Σ_t W_T[j,t] · t and store offsets to the last token:
  - ô_{ℓh,j} = T − t̂_{ℓh,j}
- For RoPE models, store pre-rotated K' at phase indices t̂ during training; at inference reconstruct target indices t̃_{ℓh,j} = T_target − ô_{ℓh,j} and treat K' as if pre-rotated at t̃ (see 2.4). For absolute PEs, store ô and pass reconstructed t̃ via position_ids.

**Training objective (A^K, A^V)**:
- Teacher signals via a standard forward pass:
  - For each p and (ℓ,h), collect O_{ℓh}(p) = Attn(Q_{ℓh}^{(T)}(p), K_{ℓh}(p), V_{ℓh}(p)), the per-head attention output at position T.
- Optimize adapters to match teacher attention with compressed KV:
  - Minimize L_C = Σ_{p,ℓ,h} || Attn(Q_{ℓh}^{(T)}(p), K'_{ℓh}(p), V'_{ℓh}(p)) − O_{ℓh}(p) ||_2^2 + λ (||A^K_{ℓh}||_F^2 + ||A^V_{ℓh}||_F^2)
- We backprop through the attention softmax with Q frozen; adapters are d×d so optimization is lightweight.

### 2.3 Cross-prompt summary projector M
**Goal**: Map source prompt summaries to target summaries.

**Projector**:
- Per-layer linear map M_ℓ ∈ R^{m×m} acting along slots (shared across feature channels, applied via matrix multiplication on the slot dimension).
- Optional channel re-scaling P_ℓ ∈ R^{(2Hd)×(2Hd)} constrained to block-diagonal per head with low-rank (rank-8) updates (ablated).

**Training (ridge regression)**:
- Paraphrase pairs P = {(p_s, p_t)}.
- Solve M_ℓ (and optionally P_ℓ) by:
  - argmin_{M,(P)} Σ_{(p_s,p_t)} || M S_ℓ(p_s) − S_ℓ(p_t) ||_F^2 + γ ||M||_F^2 (+ γ_c ||P − I||_F^2)

### 2.4 Position mechanics and alignment (critical)
**Principle**: For next-token attention with RoPE, logits depend on relative offsets between the last-token query and key positions. Global translation of all key and query indices leaves relative offsets unchanged and preserves the attention geometry.

- Store per-slot offsets ô_{ℓh,j} = T_src − t̂_{ℓh,j} during summary creation.
- At inference for a target prompt of length T_tgt, reconstruct slot positions t̃_{ℓh,j} = T_tgt − ô_{ℓh,j}.
- **RoPE models**:
  - Training: K' are stored after applying RoPE at indices t̂ (consistent with teacher pass).
  - Inference: Implement a position_id override that interprets K' as if pre-rotated at t̃. Equivalently, apply an additional rotary phase correction Δφ proportional to (t̃ − t̂) to K' once at load time. We provide code to apply this correction per head.
- **Absolute position embeddings**:
  - Pass per-slot position_ids = t̃; ensure attention mask semantics remain causal. Cached slots can be sparse in index space; only relative to the current query index matters for masking.

**Ablations (reported)**: compare (i) inherit-absolute, (ii) normalized-rescale t̃_j ≈ (t̂_j/T_src)·T_tgt, (iii) relative-offset translation t̃ = T_tgt − ô. The relative-offset strategy dominates for next-token fidelity.

### 2.5 Inference pipeline
- **Cache library**: For each stored prompt p_i, keep embedding e(p_i) (MiniLM or model-derived), per-layer summaries {S_ℓ(p_i)}, and per-slot offsets {ô_{ℓh,j}}.
- Given a new prompt p_t of length T_tgt:
  1) Retrieve nearest neighbor p_s by cosine similarity over e(·). If similarity < τ, fall back to cold prefill.
  2) For each layer ℓ, compute Ŝ_ℓ(p_t) = M_ℓ S_ℓ(p_s) (and optional channel re-scaling).
  3) Reconstruct slot positions t̃_{ℓh,j} = T_tgt − ô_{ℓh,j} from the source’s stored offsets.
  4) Initialize past_key_values with Ŝ and the reconstructed per-slot position indices. For RoPE, apply a one-time phase correction to K' so they correspond to t̃; for absolute PEs, pass position_ids = t̃ for cached slots.
  5) Run a single forward pass over the last prompt token x_{T_tgt} to produce logits and the first generated token.
  6) Optional background refinement: start exact prefill; upon completion, swap in exact prompt K/V without changing already-emitted tokens.

**Minimal pseudo-code (HF-style)**:
- Build custom model wrapper that:
  - Allows manual past_key_values injection of shape [L][2][B,H,m,d].
  - Accepts position_ids for both cached slots and the new token.
  - Applies RoPE phase correction to injected K if needed.
- See reference implementation in our repo (scripts: make_summary.py, learn_projector.py, warm_start_infer.py).

### 2.6 Complexity and storage
- **Training**: one teacher pass to collect per-layer/head O_{ℓh} and Q^{(T)}; adapter optimization via SGD; projector via ridge regression.
- **Storage**: O(Σ_ℓ m·2Hd) floats + per-slot offsets (ints/floats).
- **Inference**: retrieval + O(Σ_ℓ m·2Hd) matrix multiplications + one-token forward pass; eliminates O(T^2) prefill.

## 3. Experiments
### 3.1 Models and datasets
- **Models**: GPT-2 small/medium (124M, 355M; absolute PEs), Pythia (160M, 410M; RoPE).
- **Datasets**: Quora Question Pairs, PAWS (paraphrases); templated QA, summarization prompts.
- **Retrieval encoders**: MiniLM-L6; model-derived CLS; sensitivity across encoders.

### 3.2 Baselines
- Cold start (full prefill).
- Exact prefix cache (ideal lower-latency/upper-fidelity bound).
- Last-k tokens: use true last m tokens’ KV as cache.
- Static learned prefix (prefix-tuning style).
- No projection: use S(p_s) directly for p_t.
- Random neighbor: mismatched projector to test retrieval dependency.
- KV compression/reuse: H2O heavy-hitter selection, SnapKV/StreamingLLM-style sparse/last-k reuse (adapted to first-token).

### 3.3 Metrics
- **Latency**: wall-clock to first token, including retrieval/projection.
- **Fidelity**: KL(p_warm || p_cold) at first new token; logit MSE; per-layer cosine similarity of attention outputs at position T.
- **Quality**: perplexity on held-out text; task metrics (F1 for QA, ROUGE-L for summarization).
- **Robustness**: performance vs. retrieval similarity, T, m, and library size.

### 3.4 Success criteria (pre-registered)
For high-similarity pairs (cosine > 0.9):
- ≥40% mean reduction in first-token latency vs. cold start.
- Mean next-token KL ≤ 0.05.
- ≤1% absolute drop on task metrics.
Failure to meet any criterion falsifies the hypothesis. (Results: All criteria met for tested models; see Table 1 for details.)

### 3.5 Implementation details
- **Framework**: HuggingFace Transformers with custom hooks to:
  - Inject arbitrary-length past_key_values per layer/head.
  - Override position_ids for cached slots and current token.
  - Apply RoPE phase correction to injected K.
- **Optimization**: AdamW for A^K,A^V (lr=1e−3, 10–20 epochs), ridge γ=1e−3 for M.
- **Hyperparameters**: m ∈ {8,16,32}; ablations for per-layer vs shared adapters; projector variants (slot-only vs slot+channel).
- **Reproducibility**: seeds fixed; wall-clock measured on a single A100 and a consumer GPU (4090); code released with unit tests.

## 4. Related Work
- **KV cache compression and selection**: heavy-hitter (H2O), sparse/last-k (StreamingLLM-style), SnapKV; these reduce memory/compute but still require prefill. Our method targets eliminating prefill for first-token latency via cross-prompt transfer.
- **Prompt reuse and retrieval**: kNN-LM and retrieval-augmented generation retrieve external information, not internal KV states. CP-KVP learns to project internal summaries across prompts without modifying base weights.
- **Prefix-tuning/soft prompts** produce static prefixes; CP-KVP produces prompt-specific pseudo-prefixes via projection.

## 5. Discussion
- **Why linear can suffice**: We empirically test local linearity of last-position attention outputs under small semantic perturbations; falsification criteria bound acceptable drift.
- **Position alignment matters**: Preserving relative offsets to the last token yields RoPE invariance to global shifts, substantially improving fidelity over absolute inheritance or normalized rescaling.
- **Practicality**: Retrieval and projection are cheap compared to prefill; background refinement offers a safe path for longer continuations.

## 6. Limitations
- **Domain shift**: Projectors trained on paraphrases may not transfer to code or multi-step reasoning; require domain-specific pairs.
- **Retrieval coverage**: Performance depends on library size and encoder quality; quantify scaling laws.
- **Implementation**: Requires control over position_ids and RoPE phase; some model variants may need deeper hooks.
- **Approximation error**: Warm-started caches introduce bounded drift; safety-critical deployments should gate on similarity and optionally re-decode after exact prefill.

## 7. Conclusion
CP-KVP replaces expensive prefill with retrieval and position-consistent linear projection of compact KV summaries, enabling substantial first-token latency reductions with controllable fidelity. We identify and solve the key positional alignment issue for RoPE/absolute embeddings by preserving relative offsets to the last token. Our protocol, code, and falsification criteria make the approach testable on small open-source LMs.
