The revised draft effectively addresses the minor issues identified in its own critique, resulting in a clear, consistent, and novel contribution to LLM inference optimization. It meets all specified constraints: focused on computer science and LLM inference, highly novel in its position-consistent KV projection across prompts, suitable for a leading journal like NeurIPS or ICLR, and fully validatable with provided code, small open-source models, and pre-registered criteria. No further revisions are needed.
