The revised draft effectively addresses the minor ambiguity in positional handling for RoPE models, ensuring clarity and reproducibility. The method is highly novel, advancing LLM inference optimization through linear projection of compressed KV caches for similar prompts, with strong empirical validation via small open-source models and pre-registered criteria. It meets all constraints and is publishable in a leading journal like NeurIPS or ICML.
