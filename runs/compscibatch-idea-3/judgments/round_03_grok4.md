The revised draft presents a highly novel approach to LLM inference by enabling semantic KV cache reuse via linear projections, which is a fresh contribution beyond existing cache compression techniques. It is focused on computer science/LLM inference, designed for validation with code and small open-source models like GPT-2 and Pythia, and appears publishable in a leading journal such as NeurIPS or ICML, with a rigorous, reproducible evaluation protocol that includes clear success/falsification criteria. No major issues; the method is practical, evidence-based, and well-structured.
