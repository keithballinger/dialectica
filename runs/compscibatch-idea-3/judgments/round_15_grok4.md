Brief justification: The revised draft presents a highly novel method (CP-KVP) for accelerating LLM inference via cross-prompt KV cache reuse, with strong technical contributions in compression, projection, and position alignment for both RoPE and absolute embeddings. It is well-motivated, rigorously described, and includes open-source validation plans using small models like GPT-2 and Pythia, making it suitable for publication in a leading venue like NeurIPS or ICLR. No significant flaws; minor notation and clarity issues from the critique have been adequately addressed.
