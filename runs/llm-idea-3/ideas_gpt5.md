1) Entropy-Guided Chain-of-Thought Budgeting
Summary: Allocate reasoning token budget per query using a running entropy integral of next-token distributions to cut tokens without hurting accuracy.
For a smart layperson: Some questions need lots of thinking tokens, others need very few. By watching how unsure the model is as it writes, we let it think longer only when uncertainty is high. This should save words and time while keeping answers just as good.
Falsification: Implement an entropy controller on open 7B models (e.g., Mistral-7B, Llama-3-8B) for GSM8K, StrategyQA, and BBH; compare fixed-length CoT and self-consistency baselines to a target 30–50% token reduction with ≤1% absolute accuracy drop; ablate thresholds and uncertainty windows.
Novelty: Uses an on-the-fly entropy integral as a principled budget controller for reasoning length, rather than fixed prompts or heuristic stopping.

2) Uncertainty-Gated Decoding Mode Switching
Summary: Switch between greedy decoding and stochastic sampling per step using a calibrated uncertainty score derived from MC-dropout variance of logits.
For a smart layperson: When the model is sure, pick the top choice; when it’s shaky, explore a bit. We measure shakiness by making the model “blink” slightly (dropout) and seeing how much its opinions change, then decide to explore or not.
Falsification: Add 2–3 MC-dropout passes per step only when margin/entropy exceeds a tuned threshold; test on HumanEval/MBPP (code), TriviaQA/TruthfulQA (factuality), and GSM8K; compare accuracy and tokens to pure greedy, temperature sampling, and nucleus baselines at matched latency.
Novelty: First inference-time scheduler that uses MC-dropout disagreement to gate per-step decoding mode without model retraining.

3) Cross-Query KV Segment Reuse for Template-Heavy Agents
Summary: Reuse and splice cached key–value (KV) segments across similar prompt fragments to reduce latency and stabilize outputs in iterative agent loops.
For a smart layperson: Agents often repeat similar prompt pieces (“think, call tool, reflect”). We can cache the model’s internal state for these pieces and reuse them next time, saving work and making behavior steadier.
Falsification: Build a ReAct-style agent with calculator/search tools on HotpotQA andToolBench-like tasks; implement shingled MinHash matching over tokenized prefixes to reuse KV blocks; measure wall-clock latency, tokens, and success versus no-reuse and naive prompt caching.
Novelty: Introduces content-similarity-driven KV grafting across distinct prompts at inference, beyond standard exact-prefix caching.

4) Lattice-of-Thought Decoding with Online Pruning
Summary: Expand multiple short reasoning branches in parallel and prune them with a lightweight scorer to outperform linear CoT at the same token budget.
For a smart layperson: Instead of thinking in one straight line, the model sketches a few short possibilities, then keeps only the promising ones. This keeps options open early and wastes fewer words overall.
Falsification: Implement a fixed-budget lattice (e.g., width 3, depth 2, iterative) with a scorer using sum logprob + answer consistency; evaluate on GSM8K, SVAMP, and ARC-C; compare accuracy at equal total tokens to linear CoT and self-consistency.
Novelty: Brings beam-like branching to reasoning traces with an explicit online pruning policy optimized for token budgets, not sequence likelihood alone.

5) Lookahead-Consistency Token Filtering
Summary: Before committing a token, run cheap k-step micro-rollouts and favor tokens whose continuations agree semantically, reducing hallucinations.
For a smart layperson: If a next word leads down paths that disagree with each other, it’s risky; if short peeks ahead mostly agree, it’s safer. We only choose next words that look stable under quick peeks.
Falsification: For each step, shortlist top-p tokens, roll out k=3 short continuations with a 1–2B “draft” model, score agreement via NLI or string entailment, reweight logits accordingly; test on TruthfulQA, BioASQ-lite, and WikiSQL text-to-SQL for factuality/exact-match versus normal and speculative decoding.
Novelty: Introduces agreement-based micro-lookaheads as a token-level filter distinct from draft acceptance checks in speculative decoding.

6) Annealed Logit Noise for Controlled Exploration
Summary: Add calibrated Gaussian noise to logits early and anneal to zero, improving robustness on hard steps without harming easy ones.
For a smart layperson: A tiny nudge of randomness early helps escape bad first guesses, then we quiet it down to finish carefully. It’s like brainstorming first, polishing later.
Falsification: Implement per-step noise σ_t = σ0/(1+αt) applied only when entropy>τ; evaluate on code (HumanEval, MBPP) and long-form QA (LongForm, NarrativeQA) for pass@k, hallucination rate, and length; compare to fixed temperature and top-p schedules at matched tokens.
Novelty: Proposes an annealed noise schedule targeted by per-step uncertainty, decoupled from temperature, as an inference-only robustness mechanism.

7) Token-Wise Attention Skyline Pruning
Summary: Prune low-impact past tokens online by maintaining a “skyline” of cumulative attention mass and skipping keys/values below a dynamic threshold.
For a smart layperson: The model often barely looks at many earlier words; we track which past words matter and stop considering the rest, saving compute without changing meaning.
Falsification: Implement skyline masks per head with threshold chosen to preserve ≥95% cumulative attention; test on MMLU, GSM8K, and summarization (CNN/DM) for accuracy/ROUGE versus full attention while measuring speed/memory gains on 7B models.
Novelty: A simple, streaming, per-token cumulative-attention criterion for KV pruning that needs no retraining or head importance precomputation.

8) Learned Self-Consistency Aggregation from Trace Features
Summary: Train a small aggregator to weight and select among multiple reasoning samples using features from the traces, reducing required samples.
For a smart layperson: When we ask the model to think multiple ways, some thoughts are more trustworthy. A tiny helper learns to spot better thoughts by looking at clues like confidence and agreement.
Falsification: Generate k=5–10 CoT samples; compute features (answer agreement, mean logprob, entropy, trace length); fit a logistic regressor or tiny MLP on validation to predict correctness; evaluate on GSM8K/BBH reducing k while matching baseline accuracy.
Novelty: Moves beyond majority vote by learning a trace-level aggregator from inexpensive features, cutting self-consistency cost.

9) Logit-Lens Early Exit per Token
Summary: Exit decoding early at intermediate layers when their “logit-lens” predictions match the final layer within a calibrated margin, reducing per-token latency.
For a smart layperson: If a middle stage of the model already knows the next word, we stop the rest of the computation for that token. This speeds things up without changing outputs much.
Falsification: Calibrate per-layer agreement thresholds on a held-out set; at inference, compute logits at selected layers and skip remaining layers if within margin; measure exact-match preservation, speed, and energy on Mistral-7B across WikiText-103 perplexity and downstream tasks.
Novelty: A practical, calibration-based early-exit rule for decoder-only LLMs using intermediate logit-lens agreement, not confidence heuristics alone.

10) Adaptive Tool-Call Thresholding via Uncertainty–Cost Tradeoff
Summary: In agents, trigger tool calls only when predicted answer uncertainty exceeds a dynamic threshold that accounts for tool latency and historical utility.
For a smart layperson: Tools (like web search) are helpful but slow; we call them only when the model seems unsure and the tool is worth the wait, based on past benefit.
Falsification: Implement uncertainty estimator (entropy/margin + history-based value model) in a ReAct agent with search/calculator on HotpotQA and WebQuestions; compare success rate, latency, and tool calls to always-call, never-call, and fixed-threshold baselines.
Novelty: Formalizes tool-use as an online decision policy balancing uncertainty and cost at inference, with a simple learned value model guiding calls.
