1) Score: 9/10 — This presents a highly novel, practical, and cleanly falsifiable link between a core capacity and standard device metrics.
2) Score: 9/10 — The concept of a device-calibrated phase diagram for adaptive measurement advantage is novel and the test is sharp.
3) Score: 8/10 — This provides a concrete, experimentally feasible demonstration of the fundamental concept of superadditivity using realistic noise.
4) Score: 8/10 — Testing a strong-converse law on near-term hardware with short blocks is a novel and timely experimental goal.
5) Score: 7/10 — This is a useful, hardware-aware formula, though QRACs are a well-studied topic, making the novelty slightly more incremental.
6) Score: 7/10 — This is a novel information-balance identity, but its reliance on tomography makes falsification more experimentally demanding and statistically challenging.
7) Score: 9/10 — It presents a strong, counter-intuitive, and testable claim about the sub-optimality of maximal entanglement for a canonical channel.
8) Score: 7/10 — The link between shadow compressibility and min-entropy is highly novel, but falsification is challenging due to the statistical difficulty of estimating min-entropy.
9) Score: 9/10 — This cleverly reframes a ubiquitous hardware bug as a quantifiable and testable information-theoretic channel, which is a highly novel perspective.
10) Score: 9/10 — It introduces a novel and practical sub-tomographic tool with a verifiable performance guarantee, addressing a key experimental challenge.
