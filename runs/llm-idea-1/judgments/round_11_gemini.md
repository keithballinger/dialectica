The proposed method, Entropy-Integral Halting (EIH), is a novel, training-free, and well-motivated approach for adaptively controlling Chain-of-Thought generation length. It directly addresses an important efficiency-quality trade-off in LLM inference. The manuscript is exceptionally clear, and the method is sound. The dual-condition halting mechanism, which combines a bounded integral of smoothed entropy with a local stability check, is a robust design that mitigates the brittleness of simpler heuristics. The technical implementation details, including the explicit clarification of parameter roles (`U_max`, `L_max`) and the handling of the answer-phase transition, are correct and well-documented. The pre-registered evaluation protocol is rigorous and aligns with best practices for reproducibility. The work meets the criteria for publication in a leading venue.
